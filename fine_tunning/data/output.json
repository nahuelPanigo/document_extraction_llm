Contributingauthors:backe@uni-mainz.de; Abstract Monte Carlo simulations have been performed for 855 MeV and 6.3 GeV electrons channeling in silicon single crystals at circular bent (111) planes. The aim was to identify critical experimental parameters which effect the volume-deflection and volume-capture characteristics. To these belongs the angular alignment of the crystal with respect to the nominal beam direc- tion. The continuum potential picture has been utilized. The simulation results were compared with experiments. It turns out that the assumption of an anticlastic bending of the crystal, bent on the principle of the quasi- mosaic effect, is not required to reproduce the experimental observations.

ABSTRACT The four longest period Kuiper belt objects have orbital periods close to integer ratios with each other. A hypothetical planet with orbital period \u223c 17,117 years, semimajor axis \u223c 665 AU, would have N/1 and N/2 period ratios with these four objects. The orbital geometries and dynamics of resonant orbits constrain the orbital plane, the orbital eccentricity and the mass of such a planet, as well as its current location in its orbital path. Subject headings: Kuiper belt: general, planets and satellites: dynamical evolu- tion and stability, planets and satellites: detection, celestial mechanics 1. The most distant Kuiper belt objects In the outer solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune is a large belt of minor plan- ets, the Kuiper belt, whose dynamics has been understood, over the past two decades, to be significantly controlled by the gravity of the giant planets, Jupiter\u2014Neptune, either through secular or resonant perturbations or by gravitational scattering. However, there are a few known Kuiper belt objects [KBOs] that are unlikely to be significantly perturbed by the known giant planets in their current orbits. In the dynamical classification scheme for the small bodies of the outer solar system, such objects (semimajor axis, a, and perihe- lion distance, q, exceeding 150 AU and 40 AU, respectively) would likely belong in a class known as \u201cdetached objects\u201d, distinct from the classical KBOs, the resonant KBOs and the scattered/scattering KBOs (Gladman et al. 2008).

Introduction The internal dynamics of physical systems and their interaction with the surroundingsare strongly influenced by conser- vation laws. This includes the energy balance relations which manifest themselves in the structure of governing equations forsuch systems. Being woveninto LagrangianandHamiltonianmechanics,this specific structureis takeninto accountand plays an important part in analysis and control design for port-Hamiltonian systems [10], [11], [17]. Energy transfer and dissipation(forexample,intheformofviscousdamping,mechanicalfrictionorelectricalresistance)arecrucialmechanisms whichunderliethe collectivebehaviorin connectionsof suchsystemsandcanbe usedforachievingtheirstabilityandother performance specifications [18], [20]. The control-by-interconnectionparadigm is alternative to the measurement-actuation controlapproachand applies not only to classical systems but also extends to coherent(that is, measurement-free)quantum control settings [4], [13]. Despite the novelty of its modern applications, this approach was used in centrifugal governors [9] long before the age of controllers with analog or digital processing of electrical signals. The energy flows between interacting systems of interest (for example, the plant and controller) obey balance equations whichareusuallyformulatedintermsoftheinternalenergyofthesystem,specifiedbyitsHamiltonian,theenergydissipation and the system-environmentcoupling. These concepts have a general representation in the form of storage and supply rate functionsinthetheoryofdissipativesystems[20],wheretheunderlyingprocesses(includingtheexternalforces)areusually representedby deterministic functionsof time (satisfying localsquare integrabilityconditions).For finite-dimensionallinear time-invariantsystems, the properties of being passive, positive real or negativeimaginary (in the case of position variables instead of the velocity as the output) admit criteria in the form of linear matrix inequalities for the transfer functionsin the frequency domain or the state-space matrices themselves [14], [21]. These criteria have extensions to infinite networks of such systems [19]. The present paper is concerned with a class of stochastic Hamiltonian systems driven by random external forces. Their dynamics are governed by Ito stochastic differential equations (SDEs) whose structure is specified by system energetics in termsofaHamiltonian,viscousdampingparametersandsystem-environmentcouplingfunctions.Weconsiderenergybalance relationsforsuchsystemswithanemphasisonlinearstochasticHamiltonian(LSH)systemswithquadraticHamiltoniansand linearcoupling.ForLSHsystems,wealsodiscussstabilityconditions,thestructureoftheinvariantGaussianmeasureandits relation with stochastic versions of the virial theorem [2]. Using Lyapunov functions, organised as deformed Hamiltonians, robust stability estimates are also obtained for LSH systems driven by statistically uncertain external forces. The latter are modelled as Ito processes whose drift and diffusion parts satisfy sector boundedness conditions which are similar to those in [12]. We outline an application of these results to feedback connections of LSH systems. The paper is organised as follows. Section II specifies the class of stochastic Hamiltonian systems. Section III discusses energybalance relations.Section IV describesthe class of LSH systemsand providesstability conditions.Section V studies theinvariantmeasureoftheLSHsystemanditsconnectionwiththevirialtheorem.SectionVIdiscussesdissipationrelations fortheLSHsystemdrivenbyastatisticallyuncertainrandomforce.SectionVIIappliestheseresultstofeedbackconnections of LSH systems.

An entropic measure of time with a number of properties leading to an analog of the Galileo\u2013Einstein relativity principle is considered. Using this measure and a simple model, a kinematic law which relates time to the size and number of particles of a system is obtained. Corollaries of this law are examined. In particular, accelerated growth of the system size is obtained, whereas in systems with constant size decrease in the number of particles is observed. An interesting corollary is the emergence of repulsive and attractive forces inversely proportional to the square of the system size for relatively dense systems and constant for systems with sufficiently low density. Keywords: measure of time; entropy; laws of motion; repulsive and attractive forces. 1. Introduction By studying certain properties of the surrounding world, a physicist would usually formulate some tentative theory. Such theories are usually composed of three parts: (1) basic (initial) concepts, (2) laws (or principles), and (3) a number of assumptions and idealizations (model). In the case of mechanics1, the first part may consist of concepts of time, space, mass, etc.; the second may be represented by the Newton laws, including the law of gravity and the principle of least action. In mechanics there are many assumptions and idealizations. For example, these include point mass, free body, closed system, perfectly elastic collision, Euclidean (as well as isotropic, homogeneous) space, etc. When corollaries of the tentative theory are analyzed, especially when compared with experiment, a number of problems arise which, in their turn, lead to refinements and modifications of the tentative theory (see Fig.1a). Thanks to such refinements, contradictions between components forming three parts of the theory are eliminated or smoothed out. It should be noted that experimental data are interpreted within the framework of the tentative theory in its current, provisional form. After a number of iterations, the theory looks more or less complete (to the majority of scientists) for a rather long period until some new \u201cunexpected\u201d problem comes up. This results in new and sometimes substantial adjustments in the tentative theory causing the so-called scientific revolution. This is a well-known process described by historians and philosophers of science long ago (specifically by K. Popper, T. Kuhn, and I. Lakatos) (Fig.1a). In the history of physics and technology, this method proves to be very effective and productive. However, such a development of theory has methodological disadvantages. Let us list them. 1. Basic concepts (the \u201clanguage\u201d of a theory) are usually based neither on measurements nor on logical operations. They are introduced by definition (axiomatically), based on conscious and/or subconscious experience gained through interactions with the surrounding world <h2>(observations </h2> and <h2>experiments). </h2> The best example of this is the introduction of time in mechanics (see, e.g., the well-known and respected textbook on theoretical physics [1]). The conventional description fails to give any idea how time should be measured or introduced (without being based on laws of mechanics obtained only on the assumption that time exists and has some properties). Why can time be considered homogeneous, regular, 1 In what follows, we shall base our reasoning on mechanics as the most developed and fundamental branch of physics. "

Whilst an increasing amount of the literature covers different aspects of CD, little is known about the role of software architecture in CD and how an application should be (re-) architected to enable and support CD. We have conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data through in- depth, semi-structured interviews with 21 industrial practitioners from 19 organizations, and a survey of 91 professional software practitioners. Based on a systematic and rigorous analysis of the gathered qualitative and quantitative data, we present a conceptual framework to support the process of (re-) architecting for CD. We provide evidence-based insights about practicing CD within monolithic systems and characterize the principle of \u201csmall and independent deployment units\u201d as an alternative to the monoliths. Our framework supplements the architecting process in a CD context through introducing the quality attributes (e.g., resilience) that require more attention and demonstrating the strategies (e.g., prioritizing operations concerns) to design operations-friendly architectures. We discuss the key insights (e.g., monoliths and CD are not intrinsically oxymoronic) gained from our study and draw implications for research and practice. Keywords - Software architecture, continuous delivery, continuous deployment, DevOps, empirical study. 1. Introduction Development and Operations (DevOps) is a relatively new software development paradigm that promises many benefits such as solving the disconnect between development and operations teams, faster development and deployment of new changes, and faster failures detection [1-3]. Continuous integration, delivery, and deployment practices are key DevOps practices to fully realize the promises of DevOps without compromising quality [1]. Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of integrating code changes constantly (i.e., at least daily) into the main branch and entails automated build and testing [4, 5]. As shown in Figure 11, CI is the first and core enabler for adopting continuous delivery and deployment practices [2, 6]. Whilst continuous delivery is focused on keeping software releasable all the time, continuous deployment extends it in order to continuously and automatically deploy new changes into production [7]. Precise definitions of continuous delivery and deployment are often missing in both the literature and industrial circles [5, 7, 8]. Continuous deployment is a push-based approach, by which code changes are automatically deployed to a production environment through a pipeline as soon as they are ready, without human intervention [9]. Continuous delivery is a pull-based approach, in which a person (e.g., a manager) is required to decide which and when production-ready code changes should be released to production [9]. Figure 1 shows the relationship between these practices and how an application is deployed to different environments [10]. Whilst a production environment is where the applications or services are available for end users, a staging environment aims at simulating the production environment as closely as possible. Continuous delivery and deployment share common characteristics and are highly correlated and intertwined [11, 12]. Hence, we refer to Continuous Delivery and Deployment (CD) as CD practices in this paper. To support CD, organizational processes and practices may need to change and/or be supplemented by innovative tools and approaches. To this end, several efforts have been allocated to study and understand how organizations effectively adopt and implement CD practices. A number of studies emphasize the importance of choosing appropriate tools and technologies to design and augment modern deployment pipelines to improve the software delivery cycle [13-15]. Other research argues that the highly complex and challenging nature of CD practices requires changes in a team\u2019s structures, mindset, and skill set to gain the maximum benefits from these practices [16, 17]. The other areas of interest in CD research are focused on improving automation in testing and deployment, and integrating performance and security into the deployment process [18]. 1 Note that some of icons used in this figure are taken from freepik.com and thenounproject.com Preprint - accepted to be published in Empirical Software Engineering (2018) 1 "

We create synthetic observations based on the Spitzer and Herschel telescopes by modeling active galactic nuclei contamination, smoothing based on angular resolution, cropping the field-of-view, and removing close neighbors and low-mass sources. We extract star-gas properties such as the dense gas mass fraction, the Class II:I ratio, and the S-G correlation (\u03a3 /\u03a3 ) from YSO gas the simulation and compare them to observations of giant molecular clouds, young clusters, and star- forming regions, as well as to analytical models. We find that the simulation reproduces trends in the counts of young stellar objects and the median slope of the S-G correlation. This implies that the S-G correlation is not simply the result of observational biases but is in fact a real effect. However, otherstatistics, suchastheClassII:Iratioanddensegasmassfraction, donotalwaysmatchobserved equivalentsinnearbyclouds.

The Askey\u2013Wilson operator, applied in each variable separately, maps this function to the ordinary Askey\u2013Wilson polynomials with different sets of pa- rameters.

[9]) \u221e a ,a ,...,a (a ,a ,...,a ;q) \u03d5 1 2 r ; q, z := 1 2 r n <h1>((\u22121)nqn(n\u22121)/2)1+s\u2212rzn. </h1> r s b ,...,b (q,b ,b ,...,b ;q) (cid:18) 1 s (cid:19) n=0 1 2 s n X If 0 < |q| < 1, the series converges absolutely for all z if r \u2264 s, and for |z| < 1 if r = s+1. The Askey\u2013Wilson polynomials are the most general extension of the classical orthogonal poly- nomials [1], [2], [6], [11], [12], [18]. They are most conveniently given in terms of a \u03d5 -series, 4 3 p (x) = p (x;a,b,c,d) = p (x;a,b,c,d|q) n n n <h1>q\u2212n, abcdqn\u22121, </h1> az, a/z = <h1>a\u2212n(ab,ac,ad;q) </h1> \u03d5 ;q, q , n 4 3 ab, ac, ad ! where x = (z <h1>+z\u22121)/2, </h1> and |z| < 1.

He is best known for his work in algebraic topology and the codevelopment of a branch of mathematics called topological K-theory together with the Atiyah-Singer index theorem for which he received Fields Medal (1966). He also received the Abel Prize (2004) along with Isadore M. Singer for their discovery and proof of the index the- orem, bringing together topology, geometry and analysis, and for their outstanding role in building new bridges between mathematics and theoretical physics. Indeed, his work hashelped theoretical physicists to advancetheir understanding of quantum field theory and general relativity. Michael\u2019s approach to mathematics was based primarily on the idea of finding new horizons and opening up new perspectives. Even if the idea was not validated by the mathematical criterion of proof at the beginning, \u201cthe idea would become rigorous in due course, as happened in the past when Riemann used analytic continuation to justify Euler\u2019s brilliant theorems.\u201d For him an idea was justified by the new links between different problems which it illuminated. Our experience with him is that, in the manner of an explorer, he adapted to the landscape he encountered on the way until he conceived a global vision of the setting of the problem.

Introduction. Numerous disorders, including heritable immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and asthma, neurological conditions including autism, and genetically driven diseases such as cancer, have been linked to dysregulation of human microbiota (Holleran et al., 2018; Lloyd-Price et al., 2019; Frati et al., 2019; Sharon et al., 2019; Ballen et al., 2016). However, the complex influences of microbiota on human health are not yet functionally understood.

Curie-Sk lodowskiej 1, 20-031 Lublin, Poland Abstract The STM tunneling through a quantum wire (QW) with a side-attached impurity (atom, island) is investigated using a tight-binding model and the nonequilibrium Keldysh Green function method. The impurity can be coupled to one or more QW atoms. The presence of the impurity strongly modifies the local density of states of the wire atoms, thus influences the STM tunneling through all the wire atoms. The transport properties of the impurity itself are also investigated mainly as a function of the wire length and the way it is coupled to the wire. It is shown that the properties of the impurity itself and the way it is coupled to the wire strongly influence the STM tunneling which is reflected in the density of states and differential conductance. Key words: quantum wire, tunneling, STM PACS: 68.27.Ef, 81.07.Vb, 73.40.Gk 1 Introduction The invention of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) (1) was a milestone in experimental surface physics. Moreover, it became possible to tailor and analyze small nanostructures on various conducting surfaces (2; 3). Perhaps the most spectacular and pioneering examples are the quantum corral experi- ments, in which closed atomic structures were assembled with help of atomic manipulations (4). As the STM is a real space technique, and is very sensitive to the local atomic and electronic structures, it allows to study the prop- erties of various, not necessarily periodic, structures with atomic resolution. Those include various surface reconstructions (3) and low dimensional struc- tures, like single adatoms (2; 3), islands (5; 6) or one-dimensional monoatomic chains (7)-(10).

Thus, it is free of the Zitterbewegung oscillations that would yield an ill-defined meaning to the semiclassical transport approach at short distances if derived from the pure Dirac picture. We present a detailed derivation of the collision terms in the chiral kinetic theory using the OSEFT. Collision inte- grals are derived up to order 1/E, where E is the energy of an on-shell fermion. At this order, the collision terms depends on the spin tensor of the fermion, and in the presence of chiral imbalance, it describes how a massless fermion of a given helicity interacts differently with the transverse photons of different circular polarization. In order to back up our results, we check that they allow us to reproduce the fermion decay rate in an ultradegenerate plasma with a chiral imbalance computed directly from QED. <h1>0202 </h1> <h1>beF </h1> <h1>41 </h1> <h1>]hp-peh[ </h1> <h1>2v16500.8091:viXra </h1> "

Locally repairable codes have been investigated extensively in recent yearsduetopracticalapplicationsindistributedandcloudstoragesystems. However, there are few asymptotical constructions of locally repairable codes in the literature. In this paper, we provide an explicit asymptotic construction of locally repairable codesoverarbitraryfinitefieldsfromlocalexpansionsoffunctionsatarationalplace. This construction gives a Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink type bound for locally repairable codes. Its main advantage is that there are no constraints on both locality and alphabet size. Furthermore, we show that the Gilbert-Varshamov type bound on locally repairable codes over non-prime finite fields can be exceeded for sufficiently large alphabet size. 1. Introduction Because of practical applications in distributed and cloud storage systems, locally repairable codes have been studied by many researchers [7, 10, 11, 13, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25, 28]. A code is said with locality r if every erasure of a given codeword can be recovered by accessing at most r other symbols of this codeword. Unlike in the classical coding case, only a few papers study the asymptotical behavior of locally repairable codes [3, 5, 15, 24]. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new explicit construction of asymptotically good locally repairable codes via function fields. 1.1. Locally repairable codes and some bounds. Let q be a prime power and let F be the finite field with q elements. Let C \u2286 Fn be a q-ary block code of length n. For q q each \u03b1 \u2208 F and i \u2208 {1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n}, define C(i,\u03b1) := {c = (c ,...,c ) \u2208 C : c = \u03b1}. q 1 n i ForasubsetI \u2286 {1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n}\\{i}, wedenotebyC (i,\u03b1)theprojectionofC(i,\u03b1)onI. I Then C is called a locally repairable code with locality r if, for every i \u2208 {1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n}, there exists a subset I \u2286 {1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n} \\ {i} with |I | (cid:54) r such that C (i,\u03b1) and i i Ii C (i,\u03b2) are disjoint for any \u03b1 (cid:54)= \u03b2 \u2208 F . Ii q A linear locally repairable code over F of length n, dimension k, minimum distance q d and locality r is denoted to be a q-ary [n,k,d]-linear code with locality r. It is proved in [10] that an [n,k,d]-linear code with locality r satisfies the Singleton type bound (cid:24) (cid:25) k (1) d (cid:54) n\u2212k \u2212 +2. r A code achieving the bound (1) is usually called an optimal locally repairable code. There are many different techniques to construct optimal locally repairable codes. One powerful method among them is to construct optimal locally repairable codes from automorphism groups of function fields [2, 14, 15, 23]. 1 <h1>9102 </h1> <h1>guA </h1> 5 <h1>]TI.sc[ </h1> <h1>1v17410.8091:viXra </h1> "

We say that X \u00d7Y satisfies the Uniquely Universal property (UU) iff there exists an open set U \u2286 X \u00d7Y such that for every open set W \u2286 Y there is a unique cross section of U with U(x)={y \u2208Y :(x,y)\u2208U}=W. Arnold W. Miller in his paper [1] posed the following two questions: Problem 1 Does [0,1]\u00d7\u03c9 have UU? Problem 2 Does <h2>R\u00d7\u03c9 </h2> have UU? In this paper we present two constructions which give positive answers to both problems. Let us first introduce the following notation. Let X,Y be any spaces, let x \u2208 X, y \u2208 Y and A \u2286 X \u00d7Y. Then let us denote by A(x) = {a \u2208 Y : (x,a) \u2208 A} the horizontal section of set A, and by (y)A = {b \u2208 X : (b,y) \u2208 A} the vertical section of set A. Let x \u2208 <h2>2n, </h2> x = (x(0),x(1),x(2),...,x(n\u22121)), and let i \u2208 {0,1}. By x \u2322 i we denote the sequence (x(0),x(1),...,x(n\u22121),i). Let k < n, by x we denote the sequence consisting of first k elements of sequence x, i.e. |k x = (x(0),x(1),...,x(k\u22121)). |k Theorem 3 There is UU set for [0,1]\u00d7\u03c9. Proof. We will find uniquely universal closed set. The construction is as follows: Let us divide the interval [0,1] into two intervals of equal length A = 0, 1 , A = <h2>1,1 </h2> . In the next step we divide each A and A into 0 2 1 2 0 1 two <h2>in\u00e8terva2ls </h2> of <h2>equ\u00e8al le\u00e9ngth, </h2> A = 0, 1 , A = <h2>1, </h2> 1 , A = <h2>1, </h2> 3 , 01 4 00 4 2 10 2 4 A = <h2>3,1 </h2> .

Analogously, the task of generative commonsense reasoning (GCSR) asks machines to generate a description of everyday situations based on a set of concepts and an initial context (Liu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). For example, given concept words {dog, frisbee, catch, throw}, a machine is expected to generate a plausible description, e.g., \u201cA man throws a frisbee and his dog catches it in the air\u201d. Machines withGCSRskillswouldcommunicatefluidlywithhumans,e.g.,whensummarizingadocumentby preserving its key details (Sha, 2020), composing a creative story according to a set of clues (Yao etal.,2019),andgeneratingaconversationreplythatincludesspecifiedkeywords(Mouetal.,2016).

Introduction In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian operator is self-adjoint with respect to the chosen inner product. Therefore, a non-Hermitian operator, T, has to be Hermitian with respect to a different inner product to serve as the Hamiltonian for a unitary quantum system. The most general inner product that makes T as Hermitian has the formhx,yi = hAx,yi,whereh.,.iisthedefininginnerproductontheoriginalHilbert A space,andAisapositive-definiteoperatorsatisfyingthepseudo-Hermiticitycondition T = ATA 1 [1,2]. The operator A is called the metric operator, which is the basic \u2217 \u2212 ingredient of quantum theory based on the Hamiltonian operator T. The larger class of quasi-Hermitian operators gives useful flexibility in the mathematical description of physical observables in quantum mechanics. In the mathematical approach, A is considered as a positive semidefinite operator and new semi-inner product space is considered with the semi-inner product, hx,yi = hAx,yi, called the semi-Hilbertian A space. In the literature, many papers study A-bounded operators in semi-Hilbertian spaces. ArupMajumdar(correspondingauthor).Emailaddress:arupmajumdar93@gmail.com P.SamJohnson.Emailaddress:sam@nitk.edu.in "

It describes the first order approximation of the velocity field near the boundary in the zero viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations with non-slip boundary condition. One may check [14] for more introductions on the boundary layer theory. To justify the zero viscosity limit, one of key step is to deal with the well-posedness of the Prandtl equation. Due to the lack of horizontal diffusion in (1.1), the nonlinear term v\u2202 u y will lead to one horizontal derivative loss in the process of energy estimate. Up to now, the question of whether the Prandtl equation with general data is well-posed in Sobolev spaces is still open except for some special cases: Under a monotonic assumption on the tangential velocity of the outflow, Oleinik [14] \u2022 proved the local existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to (1.1). With the additional favorable condition on thepressure,Xin andZhang[17]obtained theglobal existence of weak solutions to (1.1). For the data which is analytic in x,y variables, Sammartino and Caflisch [16] established \u2022 the local well-posedness of (1.1). Later, the analyticity in y variable was removed by Lom- bardo, Cannone and Sammartino [11]. Zhang and the third author [18] also established the long time well-posedness of (1.1) for small tangential analytic data. Date: March 7, 2018. 1 "

I. INTRODUCTION Theentanglementbetweenthedifferentregionsofmany-bodyquantumsystems(seethereviews[1\u20136]andreferences therein) has emerged as an essential physical property that should be taken into account in their descriptions. In the fieldofTensorNetworks(seethereviews[7\u201317]andreferencestherein), theground-statewavefunctionisdecomposed into elementary small tensors that can be assembled in various ways in order to adapt to the geometry, to the symmetries, and to the entanglement properties of the problem under focus. In particular, various previous real- space renormalization procedures for the ground states of quantum spin chains have been reinterpreted and possibly improved within this new perspective. For instance, the Density-Matrix-Renormalization-Group (DMRG) [18\u201320] was reformulated as a variational problem based on Matrix-Products-States (MPS) that are well adapted to describe non-critical states displaying area-law entanglement. The traditional block-spin renormalization for critical points corresponds to scale-invariant Tree-Tensor-States (TTS), and has been improved via the multi-scale-entanglement- renormalization-ansatz(MERA)[21,22],where\u2019disentanglers\u2019betweenblocksareintroducedbesidestheblock-coarse- graining isometries already present in Tree-Tensor-States. Finally in the field of disordered spin chains, the Strong Disorder Renormalization Group (SDRG) approach introduced by Daniel Fisher [23\u201325] (see the reviews [26, 27] for furtherreferences)hasbeenreformulatedeitherasaMatrix-Product-Operator-Renormalizationorasaself-assembling Tree-Tensor-Network, and various improvements have been proposed [28\u201333]. However, even in the second example where the \u2019old\u2019 block-spin renormalization procedure and the \u2019new\u2019 Tree- Tensor-State variational approach share the same entanglement architecture, the precise choice of the elementary isometries remains different. Indeed in the traditional block-spin renormalization, the isometries are determined via the diagonalization of some \u2019intra-block\u2019 Hamiltonian involving a few renormalized spins, so that one can usually obtainexplicitRGflowsfortheparametersoftherenormalizedHamiltonian. Thetwomaincriticismslevelledagainst thisprocedurecanbesummarizedasfollows: (i)atthelevelofprinciples,thechoiceofthegroundstateofthe\u2019intra- block Hamiltonian\u2019 does not take at all into account the \u2019environment\u2019 of the neighboring blocks; (ii) in practice, thereisusuallysomearbitrarinessinthedecompositionoftheHamiltonianintothe\u2019intra-block\u2019andthe\u2019extra-block\u2019 contributions that can lead to completely different outputs, so that the quality of the results strongly depends on the cleverness of the choice of the intra-block Hamiltonian. In the Tree-Tensor perspective, one considers instead the whole ground-state wavefunction as a variational tree-tensor-state involving isometries, and the optimization of each isometry is based on the minimization of the total energy of the Tree-Tensor-State. At the level of principles, the theoretical advantage is clearly that the output corresponds to the optimal Tree-Tensor-State, i.e. to the best renormalization procedure within the class of all renormalization procedures of a given dimension. In practice, the drawback is that this global optimization is more complicated and can usually be done only numerically, unless the isometries are completely fixed by the very strong quantum symmetries of the model [34]. Inthepresentpaper,thegoalistoanalyzetheexplicitpropertiesofthesimplestTree-Tensor-Statesofthesmallest bonddimensionD =2inthecontextoflong-rangedquantumspinchainswithorwithoutdisorder,inordertoanalyze more precisely the improvement given by the global optimization of the isometries with respect to the traditional block-spin procedure.

MacDonald1 1Department of Physics, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA (\u2020These authors contributed equally to this work.) (Dated: September 2, 2018) We present a theory of bilayer two-dimensional electron systems that host a spatially indirect exciton condensate when in thermal equilibrium. Equilibrium bilayer exciton condensates (BXCs) are expected to form when two nearby semiconductor layers are electrically isolated, and when the conduction band of one layer is brought close to degeneracy with the valence band of a nearby layer by varying bias or gate voltages. BXCs are characterized by spontaneous inter-layer phase coherence and counterflow superfluidity. The bilayer system we consider is composed of two tran- sition metal dichalcogenide monolayers separated and surrounded by hexagonal boron nitride. We use mean-field-theory and a bosonic weakly interacting exciton model to explore the BXC phase diagram, and time-dependent mean-field theory to address condensate collective mode spectra and quantum fluctuations. We find that a phase transition occurs between states containing one and two condensate components as the layer separation and the exciton density are varied, and derive simple approximate expressions for the exciton-exciton interaction strength which we show can be measured capacitively.

A change of symmetry occurs at the transition from a Higgs broken U(1) symmetry (superconductor) in which Cooper pairs condense in the vacuum, to a normal phase in which the U(1) symmetry is exact.

But the challenging imaging conditions when observing the Earth from space push stereo matching to its limits. In practice, the resulting digital surface models (DSMs) are fairly noisy and often do not attain the accuracy needed for high-resolution applications such as 3D city modeling. Arguably, stereo correspondence based on low-level image similarity is insufficient and should be complemented with a-priori knowledge about the expected surface geometry beyond basic local smoothness. To that end, we introduce ResDepth, a convolutional neural network that learns such an expressive geometric prior from example data. ResDepth refines an initial, raw stereo DSM while conditioning the refinement on the images. I.e., it actsasasmart,learnedpost-processingfilterandcanseamlesslycomplementanystereomatchingpipeline. Inaseriesof experiments,wefindthattheproposedmethodconsistentlyimprovesstereoDSMsbothquantitativelyandqualitatively. We show that the prior encoded in the network weights captures meaningful geometric characteristics of urban design, which also generalize across different districts and even from one city to another.

For a large coefficient of transverse friction, we find that retrograde traveling waves are optimal. The optimal snake deflection scales as the -1/4 power of the coefficient of transverse friction, in agreement with an asymptotic analysis. At the other extreme, zero coefficient of transverse friction, we propose a triangular direct wave which is optimal. Between these two extremes, a variety of complex, locally optimal motions are found. Some of these can be classified as standing waves (or ratcheting motions).

We propose a social contagion model with a tent-like adoption probability distribution to investigate the effect of this LTI characteristic on behavior spreading. We also propose a generalized edge- based compartmental theory to describe the proposed model. Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, we find a crossover in the phase transition: when the LTIcapacityisstrong,thegrowthofthefinalbehavioradoptionsizeexhibitsasecond-order phase transition. When the LTI capacity is weak, we see a first-order phase transition. For agivenbehavioralinformationtransmissionprobability,thereisanoptimalLTIcapacitythat maximizesthefinalbehavioradoptionsize.

        "original_text": "Particle Trapping in Axisymmetric Electron Holes <h1>I H Hutchinson Plasma Science and Fusion Center and Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. </h1> Abstract Electron orbits are calculated in solitary two-dimensional axisymmetric electro- static potential structures, typical of plasma electron holes, in order to establish the conditions for the particles to remain trapped. Analytic calculations of the evolu- tion of the parallel energy caused by the perturbing radial electric field (breaking magnetic-momentinvariance)areshowntoagreewellwithfullnumericalorbitintegra- tion Poincar\u00b4e plots. The predominant mechanism of detrapping is resonance between the gyro frequency in the parallel magnetic field and harmonics of the parallel bounce frequency. A region of phase-space adjacent to the trapped-passing boundary in paral- lel energy is generally stochastic because of island overlap of different harmonics, but except for very strong radial electric field perturbation, more deeply trapped orbits have well-defined islands and are permanently confined. A simple universal quantita- tive algorithm is given, and its results plotted as a function of magnetic field strength and hole radial scale-length, determining the phase space volume available to sustain the electron hole by depression of the permanently trapped distribution function. <h1>1 Background </h1> Electron holes are steady solitary electrostatic positive potential structures that sustain themselves by an electron density deficit arising from depressed phase-space density on trapped orbits [1\u20134]. They are frequently observed in one-dimensional non-linear simula- tions of plasma kinetic instabilities [4\u20138], and in observations of space plasmas [9\u201321]. The one-dimensional theory of these hole equilibria is well established, being a type of BGK mode [22]. However, in multiple dimensions, both the equilibrium and stability of these self-sustaining structures is far less well understood. Satellite observations show that elec- tron holes are generally three-dimensional [23\u201326], oblate structures, more extended in the direction perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, than parallel, but by an amount that varies with plasma and hole parameters. Also, analysis and simulation have shown that initially-one-dimensional holes are subject to instabilities [8, 27\u201337] that break them up in the transverse dimension, forming multidimensional remnants. 1 <h1>0202 </h1> <h1>guA </h1> 7 <h1>]hp-ecaps.scisyhp[ </h1> <h1>3v32240.4002:viXra </h1> "

England Physics of Living Systems Group, Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 400 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139 Near equilibrium, small current fluctuations are described by a Gaussian with a linear-response variance regulated by the dissipation. Here, we demonstrate that dissipation still plays a dominant role in structuring large fluctuations arbitrarily far from equilibrium. In particular, we prove a linear-response-like bound on the large deviation function for currents in Markov jump processes. We find that nonequilibrium current fluctuations are always more likely than what is expected from a linear-response analysis. As a small-fluctuations corollary, we derive a recently-conjectured uncertainty bound on the variance of current fluctuations. One of the most useful insights into thermodynam- ics has been that fluctuations near equilibrium are completely characterized by just one principle, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [1]. Far from equilib- rium, however, fluctuations exhibit less universal struc- ture. As such, characterizing the rich anatomy of nonequilibrium fluctuations has been handled on a case by case basis, with few universal nonequilibrium prin- ciples.

We first carry out a similar classification of exoplanets according to their density using the Gaussian Mixture Model, followed by information theoretic criterion (AIC and BIC) to determine the optimum number of components. Such a one-dimensional classification favors two components using AIC and three using BIC, but the statistical significance from both the tests is not significant enough to decisively pick the best model between two and three components. We then extend this GMM-based classification to two dimensions by using both the density and the Earth similarity index [2], which is a measure of how similar each planet is compared to the Earth. For this two-dimensional classification, both AIC and BIC provide decisive evidence in favor of three components. 1. INTRODUCTION Overthepasttwodecades,therehasbeenarevolutioninthefieldofexoplanetastronomyfollowingtheconfirmation of more than 3000 planets orbiting stars other than the Sun (see Ref. [3] for a recent review and Ref. [4] for a summaryofexoplanetdetectiontechniques). Lotofworkhasbeendonetocharacterizethepropertiesoftheexoplanets discovered using the myriad techniques [5]. Recently, Odrzywolek and Rafelski [1] (hereafter OR16) have carried out the classification of exoplanets according to their density, following a suggestion long time back [6]. OR16 fitted the exoplanet density data to lognormal distributions to determine the optimum number of components. They found three lognormal components with peak densities at 0.71 gm/cm3, 6.9 gm/cm3, and 29.1 gm/cm3 [1]. These three componentscorrespondtoice/gasgiants,iron/rocksuper-Earths,andbrowndwarfsrespectively. Theoptimumnumber of components was determined by maximizing the log-likelihood and then checking the goodness of fit for different number of components by calculating the p-value from three distinct non-parametric tests. Wewouldliketodoavariantoftheaboveanalysisbycarryingoutasimilarclassificationaccordingtodensityusing Gaussian mixture models, followed by information theoretic criterion to determine the optimum number of classes. We have previously used this procedure, to perform a unified classification of all GRB datasets using three different model comparison techniques [7]. We then extend the analysis of OR16 by considering two-dimensional classification using both the density and Earth similarity index. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the dataset and the physical quantities used for the classification. ThemathematicalbasisfortheclassificationisdiscussedinSection3.

Exoplanet Catalog Intheone-dimensionalclassification,weshallstudythetrendsobtainedfromtheconfirmeddetections,byclassifying the exoplanet database according to their densities, for which we need the mass and radius of the planets. We obtain the mass and radius information from the catalogs uploaded on the NASA Exoplanet archive1 and the Extrasolar planet encyclopedia2 as of February 18, 2017. From these datasets, we consider only those planets with measured values of mass and density, and which exist in both the datasets with the same observed values to avoid any irregular- ities and to maintain consistency in the dataset. The NASA Exoplanet archive is a NASA funded public data service, which is hosted by the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center. This catalog lists only those objects, for which their detection and planetary status is sacrosanct. As of Feb 18, 2017, it contained a total of 3440 planets out of which 531 have measured mass and radius values detected. Most of the planets listed in this catalog have been detected using transit photometry. The Extrasolar planet encyclopedia is maintained by the Meudon Observatory in Paris and as of Feb 18, 2017 contained total of 3567 planets (most of which were also detected using transit photometry), of which 615 have measured values for all the parameters. The data provided by the two catalogs is similar except for some differences in their selection criteria. The Extrasolar planet encyclopedia allows planets weighing from 60 Jupiter Mass onwards, whereas the NASA Exoplanet archive uses 30 Jupiter mass as the lower limit, which is also the reason for the smaller number of confirmed exoplanets in the latter. However, one caveat is that the catalog is continuously updatedandsometimesfalsedetectionsareremovedasthedatagetssubjectedtomorescrutiny.

While CFD neglects the arterial deformation along the car- diac cycle by applying a rigid wall simplification, on the other side the FSI simulation requires a lot of assumptions for the material properties definition and high computational costs. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a new strategy, based on Radial Basis Functions (RBF) mesh morphing technique and transient simulations, able to introduce the patient- specific changes in aortic geometry during the cardiac cycle. Starting from medical images, aorta models at different phases of cardiac cycle were recon- structed and a transient shape deformation was obtained by proper activat- ing incremental RBF solutions during the simulation process. The results, in terms of main hemodynamic parameters, were compared with two performed CFD simulations for the aortic model at minimum and maximum volume. Our implemented strategy copes the actual arterial variation during cardiac cycle with high accuracy, capturing the impact of geometrical variations on fluid dynamics, overcoming the complexity of a standard FSI approach.

These motors generate sliding forces between adjacent microtubule doublets within the axoneme, the motile cytoskeletal structure inside the flagellum. To create regular, oscillatory beating patterns, the activities of the axonemal dyneins must be coordinated both spatially and temporally. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses or strains that build up within the moving axoneme, but it is not known whichcomponentsofstressorstrainareinvolved, norhowtheyfeedbackonthedyneins. To answer this question, we used isolated, reactivate axonemes of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas as a model system. We derived a theory for beat regulation in a two- dimensional model of the axoneme. We then tested the theory by measuring the beat waveforms of wild type axonemes, which have asymmetric beats, and mutant axonemes, inwhichthebeatisnearlysymmetric,usinghigh-precisionspatialandtemporalimaging. We found that regulation by sliding forces fails to account for the measured beat, due to the short lengths of Chlamydomonas cilia. We found that regulation by normal forces (which tend to separate adjacent doublets) cannot satisfactorily account for the symmetricwaveformsofthembo2 mutants. Thisisduetothemodel\u2019sfailuretoproduce reciprocal inhibition across the axes of the symmetrically beating axonemes. Finally, we show that regulation by curvature accords with the measurements. Unexpectedly, we found that the phase of the curvature feedback indicates that the dyneins are regulated by the dynamic (i.e. time-varying) component of axonemal curvature, but not by the static one. We conclude that a high-pass filtered curvature signal is a good candidate for the signal that feeds back to coordinate motor activity in the axoneme. <h1>Author Summary </h1> The swimming of many microorganisms is powered by periodic bending motion of cilia and flagella. The flagellar beat results from a feedback: dynein motors generate sliding forces that bend the flagellum; and bending leads to deformations and stresses, which feed back and regulate motors. Three alternative feedback mechanisms have been proposed: regulation by the sliding forces, regulation by the curvature of the axoneme, 1 <h1>5102 </h1> <h1>voN </h1> <h1>31 </h1> <h1>]hp-oib.scisyhp[ </h1> <h1>1v07240.1151:viXra </h1> "

We analyse energetic electron fluxes, spectra, pitch angle distributions, associated Langmuir waves, and type III solar radio bursts for 3 events to understand what causes modifications in the electron flux and identify the origin and characteristics of features observed in the electron spectrum. We investigate what electron beam properties and solar wind con- ditions are associated with Langmuir wave growth and spectral breaks in the electron peak flux as a functionofenergy. Weobservevelocitydispersionandquasilinearrelaxationintheelectronfluxcaused by the resonant wave-particle interactions in the deca-keV range, at the energies at which we observe breaks in the electron spectrum, co-temporal with the local generation of Langmuir waves. We show, viatheevolutionoftheelectronfluxatthetimeoftheevent,thattheseinteractionsareresponsiblefor thespectralsignaturesobservedaround10and50keV,confirmingtheresultsofsimulationsbyKontar & Reid (2009). These signatures are independent of pitch angle scattering. Our findings highlight the importance of using overlapping FOVs when working with data from different sensors. In this work, we exploit observations from all in situ instruments to address, for the first time, how the energetic electron flux is modified by the beam-plasma interactions, and results into specific features to appear in the local spectrum. Our results, corroborated with numerical simulations, can be extended to a wider range of heliocentric distances.

Underpinning this reform is a consensus among educators that traditional pedagogy has not been effective in promoting statistical literacy (Cobb, 1992; Moore, 1997; Mills, 2002), a core competency for the evidence-based disciplines such as health and behavioral sciences. In spite of many years of reform efforts, there is growing evidence that students are emerging with a lack of understanding of core concepts, such as statistical variation, chance, graphing of distributions, and sampling distributions (see Delmas et al., 2006). Also, Onwuegbuzi and Leech (2003) observed that many students experience high levels of anxiety about statistics, which can pose \u201ca major threat to the attainment of their degrees\u201d. Such negative outcomes have been attributed to persistence of the traditional pedagogy, that is, \u201can overemphasis on the mathematical aspects of the subject at the expense of experience with data\u201d (Moore, 2005), fostering rote learning instead of conceptual understanding. Moreover, research from other disciplines has implicated instructors\u2019 beliefs and attitudes, as the primary explanation for their failure to use reform-based strategies (Tobin, Tippins & Gallard, 1994; Liljedahl, 2005), however, such research is lacking in statistics education. The only relevant and accessible research report, a case study of statistics instructors, concluded that \u201cthe nature and extent of the implementation\u201d of reform recommendations were \u201coften due to the instructor\u2019s experience and beliefs about teaching\u201d (Garfileld 2000, p.7). Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop and validate a scale to measure instructors\u2019 attitude toward concept-based (reform-oriented or constructivist) teaching of introductory statistics in the health and behavioral sciences at the undergraduate level. Methodology Data were obtained from a maximum variation sample of 227 statistics instructors using an internet- based survey. Established guidelines for scale development were followed (DeVellis, 1991), and structural and psychometric properties were assessed using primarily exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), multiple regression, and hierarchical cluster analyses. Acceptable <h2>factorability1 </h2> of the attitude data was established (Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity (p< .001), KMO measure of sampling adequacy = .88). In order to check for criterion validity of the attitude scale, a teaching practice scale was also developed (Table 1). Respondents in the highest quartile (of practice score) were considered high-reform instructors (concept-based or constructivist), and those in the lowest quartile, low-reform instructors (traditional, mathematical or behaviorist). Concept-based (reform-oriented or constructivist) pedagogy was defined as a set of strategies intended to promote statistical literacy by emphasizing concepts and their applications rather than calculations, procedures and formulas. It involves active learning strategies such as projects, group discussions, data collection, hands-on computer data analysis, critiquing of research articles, report writing, oral presentations, and the use of real-life data. Statistical literacy is the ability to understand, critically evaluate, and use statistical information and data-based arguments (Garfield, 1999). Attitude was conceptualized as an evaluative 1 Other assumptions were also met. A pattern coefficient (\u201cloading\u201d) of at least .4 was the main criterion for retaining items.

As data visualization techniques become cumbersome for higher dimensions and unconvincing when there is no clear separation between homogeneous subgroups within the data, cluster analysis provides an intuitive alternative. The aim of applying mixture model- based clustering in this context is to discover groups of co-expressed genes, which can shed light on biological functions and pathways of gene products.

Additionally, we construct infinitely many graphs to show that results proved in this paper givenew strength for one to determine theHamiltonicity of graphs. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a cycle that visits all vertices. It is well known that the problem of determining the Hamiltonicity of graphs is remarkably difficult [7]. Thus it is meaningful to find sufficient conditions for graphs to be Hamiltonian. A seminal result due toDirac[3]statesthatif\u03b4(G)> <h2>n,thenGisHamiltonian,here\u03b4(G)istheminimumdegree </h2> 2 of G and n is the number of vertices of G. While many known results are in terms of vertex degrees and the number of edges, Krivelevich and Sudakov showed the following breakthrough result using eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. Namely, they proved that a d-regular graph is Hamiltonian if its second largest eigenvalue (in the absolute value) of the adjacency matrix is sufficiently less than d. Butler and Chung [2] extended their result to general graphs by using eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian matrix. Both of two results mentioned above used the Po\u00b4sa\u2019s rotation method together with some discrepancy and discrete isoperimetric inequalities of graphs. In2009,FiedlerandNikiforov[5]gavelowerbounds on\u03bb(G) thatimply the Hamiltonic- ity of G, where \u03bb(G) is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of G. After that, many other spectral conditions in the same spirit for the Hamiltonicity of graphs have been discovered,seee.g.,[1,8,9,10,11,13]. Inthis paper,wewillfirstestablishasignlessLapla- cian analogue of a result due to Nikiforov [10] for graphs with large minimum degree. Then we strengthen a resultby Li andNing [8] for balanced bipartite graphs. Before we state our theorems, we briefly recall results from [10]. We need to introduce two families of graphs. We use K andK to denote the complete graphwithn verticesandthe edgelessgraph n n with n vertices respectively. For two vertex disjoint graphs G and H, we write G+H for theirdisjointunionwhichsatisfiesV(G+H)=V(G)\u222aV(H)andE(G+H)=E(G)\u222aE(H). We write G\u2228H for their join which satisfies V(G\u2228H) = V(G)\u222aV(H) and E(G\u2228H) = E(G)\u222aE(H)\u222a{xy :x\u2208V(G),y \u2208V(H)}. \u2217CenterforAppliedMathematics,TianjinUniversity,Tianjin,300072China,(yawenli@tju.edu.cn), \u2020CenterforAppliedMathematics,TianjinUniversity,Tianjin,300072China,(liuyao@tju.edu.cn), \u2021Center forAppliedMathematics, TianjinUniversity, Tianjin,300072 China, (x2peng@tju.edu.cn), Re- searchissupportedinpartbyNationalNaturalScienceFoundationofChina(No. 11601380). 1 "

Thisresultmayanticipatedifficultiesintheattempttoderivetheghost-free bigravity as a low-energy effective theory,starting with a model applicable at high energies. I. INTRODUCTION Bigravity, the theory that has two dynamical metrics interacting with each other through non-derivative interaction terms, has been investigated since the proposal in Ref. [1]. In the presence of the mass of graviton which derives from the non-derivative interaction terms, however, it is known that an additional degree of freedom generally appears and that it has a wrong-signkinetic term. Such degree of freedom causes instability at the quantum level and is called the Boulware-Deser (BD) ghost [2]. Recently, de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley discoveredthe unique ghost-free1 non-derivative interaction in the case with one non-dynamical fiducial metric, which is called dRGT massive gravity [3, 4] (see also [5]). References [6\u20138] showed that dRGT massive gravity is certainly ghost free and that the proof of ghost-freeness can be extended to the case where both metrics are dynamical. Reference [6] also argued that the case in which a matter field couples to both metrics is allowed, although such a matter field would in general violate the equivalence principle. Thisfindingmakesitpossibletostudyhealthybimetrictheory[9]. Manyworksabouttheghost-freebigravity have been done, for example, in the cosmologicalcontext for the case where each matter couples only to either metric [10\u201315] (see also [16]) and for the case where matter couples to both metrics [17\u201319]. In Refs. [11, 14, 15] they studied the nature of the cosmological solutions of the ghost-free bigravity and found that even in the healthy branch where Higuchi ghost is absent, a gradient instability appears in the high energy regime compared with the mass scale introduced in the Lagrangian in the matter-dominated or radiation-dominated era. Therefore, if the ghost-free bigravity can describe the real universe, it should exceed the range of validity in the high energy regime and it must be extended to some more fundamental theory there. Such an extension of the ghost-free bigravity is attempted in Ref. [20], where the ghost free multigravity is related to higher dimensional general relativity with a discrete extra dimension, and in Ref. [21], where the ghost-free bigravity is embeddedin the DGP 2-branemodel. Inthis context, wecannaturallyconsidermatter thatcouples toboth metrics by introducing a five-dimensional matter field. Despite the above discussion, in this paper we claim that the BD ghost generally appears when we add matter coupled to both metrics by hand to the ghost-free bigravity. This is because, when the matter has two kinetic terms which couple to respective metrics, the conjugate momentum of the matter field depends on both lapse functions and the kinetic term written by the conjugate momentum becomes nonlinear in two lapse functions. Considering perturbations on Friedmann and anisotropic background solutions, we investigate in which case an extra degree of freedom is present and whether the extra degree of freedom is a ghost mode or not. Consequently, when matter has two kinetic terms corresponding to two metrics, we find that an extra degree of freedom appears and that there is no mechanism to avoid the mode to become a ghost mode in the limit of Minkowski solution in the healthy branch. This paper is organizedas follows. In Sec. 2 we present a brief summary and a detailed follow-upcalculation of the proof that has been given by Hassan and Rosen [6\u20138]. Here we consider only the gravitational sector and confirm that the ghost-free bigravity really has four Lagrange multipliers that remain unspecified by the consistency conditions of the time evolution of the constraints, corresponding to the gauge degrees of freedom, 1 Hereandinthefollowing\u201cghost-free\u201dstrictlymeansthatthemodeldoesnothavetheBDghost,withoutexcludingthepossible existenceofanother typeofghost.

INTRODUCTION First created for commercial industry, 3D printing is increasingly used in leading-edge fields such as space instrumentation. Optical components and telescope structures are now under investigation to be printed. 3D printing provides a new vision for optics fabrication due to the large scale of techniques and materials available. Inthefieldofspaceinstrumentation,thechallengeistoimprovecrucialparameterssuchasbulkinessandweight whilstmaintainingtheopticalperformanceassurfacequality. Theuseof3Dprintingtocreatenovellightweight structures is a new and developing field. Combined with the work of topology optimisations and lattices several prototypes have been proposed by J. Mici et al. (2015),1 C.Atkins et al. (2019)2 and E.Hilpert et al. (2019).3 All the prototypes have been printed in metals and shows very good surface quality after polishing or diamond turning. 3D printing can also print ceramic material using stereolithography techniques. In traditional manufacture ceramics are often used in mirror fabrication however, there are few investigations in the use of 3D printed ceramics. Stereotlithography uses photopolymerisation reaction on a liquid resin to build the object layer by layer. In contrast, 3D printed metals utilise a thermal reaction between a laser (or electron beam) and metallic powder. In this paper we are interested in the printing of ceramics compared to metal printing and traditional manufacture, by highlighting its behaviour in terms of polishing and surface quality after printing. melanie.roulet@lam.fr <h1>0202 </h1> <h1>voN </h1> 2 <h1>]MI.hp-ortsa[ </h1> <h1>1v55800.1102:viXra </h1> "

Abstract Simulation tools for photoacoustic wave propagation have played a key role in advancing photoacoustic imaging by providing quantitative and qualitative insights into parameters affecting image quality. Classical methods for numerically solving the photoacoustic wave equation relies on a fine discretization of space and can become computationally expensive for large computational grids. In this work, we apply Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) networks as a fast data-driven deep learning method for solving the 2D photoacoustic wave equation in a homogeneous medium. Comparisons between the FNO network and pseudo- spectral time domain approach demonstrated that the FNO network generated comparable simulations with small errors and was several orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, the FNO network was generalizable and can generate simulations not observed in the training data. 1. Introduction Photoacoustic imaging is a non-invasive hybrid imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical (e.g., high contrast and molecular specificity) and ultrasound (e.g., high penetration depth) imaging [1]. It has been applied for many preclinical and clinical imaging applications such as small-animal whole-body imaging, breast and prostate cancer imaging, and image-guided surgery [2]\u2013[5]. Multispectral photoacoustic imaging can be used for functional imaging such as measuring blood-oxygen saturation and metabolism in biological tissues [6]. Photoacoustic imaging provides both structural and functional information that can potentially reveal novel insights into biological processes and disease pathologies [7]. In photoacoustic tomography (PAT), a tissue medium is illuminated using a short-pulsed laser. Optically absorbing molecules within the medium are excited and undergo thermoelastic expansion resulting in the generation of photoacoustic waves that are subsequently measured using an array of acoustic sensors [1]. An image representing the initial pressure distribution can be reconstructed from the measured time-dependent signals using analytical solutions, numerical methods, and model-based iterative methods [8]\u2013[12]. A detailed understanding of parameters describing the imaging medium (e.g., optical, thermal, and acoustic properties of the "

Introduction The discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS [1] and CMS experiments [2] in 2012 markedthecompletionoftheStandardModel(SM)ofparticlephysics. However,evenwith direct measurements of all SM parameters, it is not possible to predict all known phenom- ena as the SM does not describe dark matter nor is it a quantum theory of gravity. These challenges, in addition to other technical and aesthetic ones, have motivated an impres- sive program to search directly for new particles and forces at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Despite the lack of significant evidence for physics beyond the SM, direct searches will continue to play a central role in the LHC program. An important complement of direct searches is indirect searches by testing the consis- tency of the SM. Recent global fits to electroweak observables are able to place important constraintsonnewphenomena,inparticularrelatedtoHiggsbosons[8,9]. Thestrongforce sectoroftheSMcanalsobeusedtoset(nearly)model-independentconstraintsonnewcol- ored particles. In particular, measurements sensitive to hard quantum chromodynamical (QCD) radiation at multiple scales can probe physics beyond the SM (BSM) through the running of the strong coupling constant, \u03b1 . For example, an interpretation of e+e\u2212 mea- s surements in Ref. [10] sets robust limits on gluinos up to about 50 GeV. A similar strategy with pp data in Ref. [11] extends these limits to about 300 GeV. Direct searches for gluinos arecurrentlyabletoprobethemulti-TeVregime[3,6]. However,directsearchesmustmake assumptionsaboutthedecayofthegluino.

For thermal radiation, where the typical dimension is provided by Wien\u2019s wavelength, Planck\u2019s law and associated concepts describing surface-to-surface radiative transfer have to be replaced by a full electromagnetic framework capturing near-field radiative heat transfer (photon tunnelling between close bodies), interference effects and sub-wavelength thermal emission (emitting body of small size). It is only during the last decade that nanotechnology has allowed for many experimental verifications - with a recent boom - of the large increase of radiative heat transfer at nanoscale. In this minireview, we highlight the parameter space that has been investigated until now, showing that it is limited in terms of inter-body distance, temperature and object size, and provide clues about possible thermal-energy harvesting, sensing and management applications. We also provide an outlook on open topics, underlining some difficulties in applying single-wavelength approaches to broadband thermal emitters while acknowledging the promises of thermal nanophotonics and observing that molecular/chemical viewpoints have been hardly addressed.

In the last twenty years, a huge community transport and conversion at the nanoscale dealing with nanophotonics, i.e. the engineering of matter to confer it particular properties for routing light and enhancing The current energy challenge, which requires saving energy or absorption/emission at particular wavelengths, has expanded. At the energy harvesting in order to limit the greenhouse gas emissions, crossroad of these fields, i.e. energy management and requires a fresh eye on many thermodynamic concepts. They date nanophotonics, nanoscale thermal radiation effects are being back to the XIXth century, when the laws of thermodynamics were studied and have the potential for many novel applications. In this established by famous names such as Carnot, Boltzmann, and many context, this minireview aims at summarizing the types of others. Heat transfer has been studied more accurately since that configurations already tested experimentally and pointing to time. While heat conduction and convection are usually well advances expected for applications of nanoscale radiative heat understood (in particular because they are described by local partial transfer in the near future, therefore complementing previous differential equations), radiative heat transfer, i.e. the transfer of general reviews1\u20133. Thermal management, energy conversion and heat by photons, is often tackled in simplified ways. It is generally spectroscopy are among the key application fields. addressed either by considering surface-to-surface thermal radiation or radiation in semi-transparent/participating media. The first way considers thermal radiation only as a surface property, omitting that photon emission takes place in some matter volume. The second way, which is solved with the Radiative Transfer Equation, is more complex as non-local interaction is to be considered (volumes located very far from each other interact all the time). In both cases the wave nature of thermal radiation is largely neglected. Among the neglected phenomena, interference effects are of course to be mentioned, but other types of wave effects, such as tunnelling, are Fig. 1: Nanoscale radiative heat transfer. a) Sub-wavelength thermal emission from a also out of the framework.

Juni 135, Berlin, Germany Abstract Frank-Wolfe algorithms (FW) are popular first-order methods for solving constrained convex optimization problems that rely on a linear minimization oracle instead of potentially expensive projection-like oracles. Many works have identified accelerated convergence rates under various structural assumptions on the optimization problem and for specific FW variants when using line-search or short-step, requiring feedback fromtheobjectivefunction. Littleisknownaboutacceleratedconvergenceregimeswhenutilizingopen-loop step-size rules, a.k.a. FW with pre-determined step-sizes, which are algorithmically extremely simple and stable. Not only is FW with open-loop step-size rules not always subject to the same convergence rate lower bounds as FW with line-search or short-step, but in some specific cases, such as kernel herding in infinite dimensions, it has been empirically observed that FW with open-loop step-size rules enjoys to faster convergence rates than FW with line-search or short-step. We propose a partial answer to this unexplained phenomenon in kernel herding, characterize a general setting for which FW with open-loop step-size rules converges non-asymptotically faster than with line-search or short-step, and derive several accelerated convergenceresultsforFWwithopen-loopstep-sizerules. Finally,wedemonstratethatFWwithopen-loop step-sizes can compete with momentum-based open-loop FW variants. Keywords: Frank-Wolfe algorithm, open-loop step-sizes, acceleration, kernel herding, convex optimization <h1>1. Introduction </h1> In this paper, we address the constrained convex optimization problem minf(x), (OPT) x\u2208C where C \u2286 Rd is a compact convex set and f: C \u2192 R is a convex and L-smooth function. Let x\u2217 \u2208 argmin f(x) be the constrained optimal solution. A classical approach to addressing (OPT) is to apply x\u2208C projected gradient descent. When the geometry of C is too complex, the projection step can become computationally too expensive. In these situations, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) (Frank and Wolfe, 1956), a.k.a. the conditional gradients algorithm (Levitin and Polyak, 1966), described in Algorithm 1, is an efficient alternative, as it only requires first-order access to the objective f and access to a linear minimization oracle (LMO) for the feasible region, that is, given a vector c \u2208 Rd, the LMO outputs argmin \u27e8c,x\u27e9. At each x\u2208C iteration, the algorithm calls the LMO, p \u2208argmin \u27e8\u2207f(x ),p\u2212x \u27e9, and takes a step in the direction of t p\u2208C t t the vertex p to obtain the next iterate x = (1\u2212\u03b7 )x +\u03b7 p .

Previousstudiesevaluatingthesensitivities of experiments have often focused on simple, but not particularly well-motivated, models in which the HNL mixes with only one active neutrino flavor. In this work, we accurately simulate models for HNL masses between 100 MeV and 10 GeV and arbitrary couplings to e, \u00b5, and \u03c4 leptons. We include over 150 HNL production channels and over 100 HNL decay modes, including all of the processes that can be dominant in some region of the general parameter space. The result is HNLCalc, a user-friendly, fast, and flexible library to compute the properties of HNL models.

Namely, necessary and sufficient BFB conditions derived for the case with an exact symmetry can be ruined by introducing soft symmetry breaking terms. Using S 4 and A -symmetric three-Higgs-doublet models as an example, we argue that all published 4 necessary and sufficient BFB conditions, even those which are correct for the exactly sym- metric case, are no longer sufficient if soft symmetry breaking is added. Using the geometric formalism, we derive the exact necessary and sufficient BFB conditions for the 3HDM with the symmetry group S , either exact or softly broken, and review the situation for the A - 4 4 symmetric case. <h1>0202 </h1> <h1>yaM </h1> <h1>92 </h1> <h1>]hp-peh[ </h1> <h1>1v63000.6002:viXra </h1> "

Wakker, Blair D. Savage2, Brian A. Keeney, J. Michael Shull, John T. Stocke3 & Kenneth R. Sembach4 Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal ABSTRACT We present a clear detection of a broad Ly\u03b1 absorber (BLA) with a matching Ovi line in the nearby universe. The BLA is detected at z(Ly\u03b1) = 0.01028 in the high S/N spectrum of Mrk 290 obtained using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. The Ly\u03b1 absorption has two components, with b(H i)=55 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 and b(H i)=33 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121, separated in velocity by v \u223c115 km s\u22121. The Ovi, detected by FUSE at z(Ovi) = 0.01027, has a b(Ovi) = 29 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 and is kinematically well aligned with the broader H i component. The non-detection of other ions such as C ii, Si ii, Fe ii, C iii, Si iii, C iv, Si iv and Nv at the same velocity as the BLA and the Ovi implies that the absorber is tracing highly ionized gas. The different line widths of the BLA and Ovi suggest a temperatureofT =1.4\u00d7105 K inthe absorber. Photoionziation,collisionalionizationequilibriumas wellas nonequilibrium collisionalionizationmodels do not explain the ionratios atthis temperature. The observed line strength ratios and line widths favor an ionization scenario in which both ion- electron collisions and UV photons contribute to the ionization in the gas. Such a model requires a low-metallicity of \u223c \u22121.7 dex, ionization parameter of log U \u223c \u22121.4, a large total hydrogen column density of N(H) \u223c 4\u00d71019 cm\u22122, and a path length of \u223c 400 kpc. The line of sight to Mrk 290 intercepts at the redshift of the absorber, a megaparsec scale filamentary structure extending over \u223c 20 deg in the sky, with several luminous galaxies distributed within \u223c 1.5 h\u22121 Mpc projected distance from the absorber. The collisionally ionized gas phase of this absorber is most likely tracing a shock-heated gaseous structure, consistent with a few different scenarios for the origin including an over-dense region of the WHIM in the galaxy filament or highly ionized gas in the extended halo of one of the galaxies in the filament. In general, BLAs with metals provide an efficient means to study T \u223c105\u2212106 K gas in galaxy halos and in the intergalactic medium. A substantial fractionof the baryons missing from the present universe is predicted to be in such environments in the form of highly ionized plasma. 1. INTRODUCTION a mix of multiple gas phases.

In this paper we have developed analytical method to solve the system of fractional differential equations in-terms of Mittag-Leffler function and generalized Sine and Cosine functions, where the fractional derivative operator is of Jumarie type. The use of Jumarie type fractional derivative, which is modified Rieman-Liouvellie fractional derivative, eases the solution to such fractional order systems. The use of this type of Jumarie fractional derivative gives a conjugation with classical methods of solution of system of linear integer order differential equations, by usage of Mittag-Leffler and generalized trigonometric functions. The ease of this method and its conjugation to classical method to solve system of linear fractional differential equation is appealing to researchers in fractional dynamic systems. Here after developing the method, the algorithm is applied in physical system of fractional differential equation. The analytical results obtained are then graphically plotted for several examples for system of linear fractional differential equation.

A row projection specifies how many grid points are covered by tiles in a given row; column projections are defined analogously. For a fixed tile, is it possible to reconstruct its tilings from their projections in polynomial time? It is known that the answer to this question is affirmative if the tile is a bar (its width or height is 1), while for some other types of tiles NP-hardness results have been shown in the literature. In this paper we present a complete solution to this question by showing that the problem remains NP-hard for all tiles other than bars. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> Discrete tomography deals with reconstructing finite spatial objects from their low-dimensional projections.

The exchange interaction in particular leads to creating of bubbles - spherical cavities with electron in center. Good object for such study is system of surface electrons formed over surface of dielectric with small permittivity. Investigation of the autolocalization of SE on liquid helium surface attracts high attention, because system is the extremely clear and easily governed. Bubbles have small mobility relatively of free electrons and that is used for monitoring of the transition process. As has recently been investigated the quasi-one-dimensional electrons over liquid helium form the autolocalized states at smaller gas density in compared to 3D and 2D situations. The process significantly depends from a substrate and its quality. The autolocalization of one-dimensional electrons in a gas phase over liquid helium covering a substrate at both situations with or without the potential variations is theme of present study. The features of conductivity in presence of potential variations the authors explain by both the dynamic processes of changing the subsystem energy at appear or disappear electron autolocalization and by thermo-insulation of electron subsystem from thermostat. Introduction The interaction of the electrons with neutral matter isn\u2019t trivial and attracts large attention of physicists of many science directions, such as, condensed matter physics; nano-physics; physics of plasma and high energy. Are known next consequences of exchange interaction: the appearance of bubbles (spherical cavities with electron in center); the distortion of the matter energy spectrum; the stimulation of positron annihilation. Appearance and disappearance of the autolocalized electrons is observed in [1-3]. The main intrigue this phenomena is influence of substrates and fields. The investigations of the electron bubbles in the bulk helium and gas phase described in [1-2, 4]. Good object of same investigation is surface electrons (SE). SE is formed over smooth surface of dielectric with small permittivity [see for ex. 5-6]. The investigation of the autolocalization SE on liquid helium surface attracts high attention, because system is the extremely clear and easily governed. The electron bubble has expressed energy spectrum and can be used as bit of the quantum computer, like SE was proposed for this target in [7, 8]. It was shown that the autolocalization of the electrons take place at smaller gas density in compared to 3D and 2D situation [2, 9].

This formalism aims to generalize the Lambek calculus (L) to hypergraphs as hyperedge replacement grammars extend context-free grammars. In contrast to the Lambek calculus, HL deals with hypergraph types and sequents; its axioms and rules naturally generalize those of L. Consequently, certain properties (e.g. the cut elimination) can be lifted from L to HL. It is shown that L can be naturally embedded in HL; moreover, a number of its variants (LP, NL, NLP, L with modalities, L\u2217(1), LR) can also be embedded in HL via different graph constructions. We also establish a connection between HL and Datalog with embedded implications. It is proved that the parsing problem for HL is NP-complete. 2012ACMSubjectClassification Theoryofcomputation\u2192Linearlogic;Mathematicsofcomputing \u2192 Hypergraphs Keywords and phrases hypergraphs, Lambek calculus, calculus, graph grammars, Datalog Digital Object Identifier 10.4230/LIPIcs...

Here we consider its standard variant called the Lambek calculus (in the Gentzen style); below it is denoted as L. Besides its mathematical significance (it can be considered as a fragment of linear or of intuitionistic logic), the Lambek calculus forms the basis for Lambek grammars, which serve to describe formal languages. Such grammars assign logical types to symbols and accept a string if a sequent composed of these types is derivable in L. Lambek grammars are opposed to context-free grammars, which generate strings using productions. Since 1958 until nowadays the Lambek calculus has been significantly improved, its different extensions have been presented in a number of works. Some extensions that are of interest in this paper are the following: L\u2217 (Lambek calculus with the unit); L with 1 modalities, which is presented in [10]; L with the reversal operation; L with the permutation ruleLP. Oneoftheobjectivesofsuchextensionsistocaptureandnaturallydescribedifficult linguistic phenomena (see e.g. [10]). Many fundamental properties of the Lambek calculus and of its extensions have been discovered. Pentus proved that the derivability problem in L is NP-complete (see [14]); L-models and R-models were introduced, completeness was established in [13].

A variety of methods have been developed in recent years, yet it is still challengingtokeepaccurateestimationwhentherearecomplexcorrelationstructures among predictors and the response.

This penalty doesn\u2019t shrink variables but focuses on removing the shrinkage bias and encouraging grouping effect. Combining the l penalty and the Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), we propose two methods 1 called Smooth Adjustment for Correlated Effects (SACE) and Generalized Smooth AdjustmentforCorrelatedEffects(GSACE).Comparedwiththetraditionaladaptive estimator, the proposed methods have less influence from the initial estimator and can reduce the false negatives of the initial estimation. The proposed methods can be seen as linear functions of the new penalty\u2019s tuning parameter, and are shown to estimate the coefficients accurately in both extremely highly correlated variables situation and weakly correlated variables situation. Under mild regularity conditions we prove that the methods satisfy certain oracle property. We show by simulations and applications that the proposed methods often outperforms other methods.

In the high carrier density regime, the retained emission efficiency in a dry-etched nanorod sample is observed to be over two times higher than that in its parent QW sample. We further argue that the improvement is a combined effect of the amendment contributed by lateral carrier confinement and the deterioration made by surface trapping. a cfzhang@nju.edu.cn b jskwak@sunchon.ac.kr c mxiao@uark.edu 1 "

Introduction A Bermudan option can be exercised on predetermined dates before maturity. The option holder receives the exercise payoff when he/she exercises the option on specific dates at the option\u2019s maturity. Between two consecutive exercise dates, the valuation process can be regarded as similar to a European option, which can be priced and hedged using the risk-neutral valuation formula (cf. Chan 2018, Chan and Hale 2019).

If Y is a crepant resolution of X /G \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb (which exists but in general is not unique) then (X ,Y ) provides an example of \u03bb \u03bb a mirror pair. Since the birational geometry of Y is independent of the choice of \u03bb the resolution a natural question arises: to compare the birational motives of X \u03bb andY \u03bb. For a finite fieldk =F q the number of F qm-rationalpoints modulo qm is a birationalinvariantandD. Wanaskedto comparethe number ofrationalpoints of a mirror pair [W]. In the case of the Dwork family he proved a mirror congruence formula [W, Theorem 1.1]: #X \u03bb(F qm)=#Y \u03bb(F qm) mod qm for every positive integer m. Fu and Wan studied more general mirror pairs which come from quotient constructions and obtained under certain assumptions on the action of G (see Theorem 3.7) a congruence formula [FW]: (0.0.1) #X(F qm)=#(X/G)(F qm) mod qm. The same formula is proved in [BBE, Corollary 6.12] with different assumptions. The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first theorem compares the motives of X and Y when X is a member of the Dwork family, and provides Wan\u2019s \u03bb \u03bb \u03bb congruence formula as a consequence. We also explain what can be expected for generalquotientconstructions in\u00a73.

The instanton exponents and the singular structureof the coefficients dependon the continuous deformation parameters, in contrast to the superconformal case where all the parameters are integers associated with the orbifold action on the modulispace.

All the RPC will have to pass a minimum quality assurance criteria, but may not be able to maintain a good uniformity over the whole surface area, particularly for the whole running period of about twenty years.

Using a harmonic oscillator potential we calculate the elliptic anisotropy and find it to be sizeable compared to elliptic flow measurements in nuclear collisions. Our results question the validity of the completely hydrodynamic interpretation of anisotropic flow data, and highlight theimportance of including quantumphysics in hydrodynamiccalculations which has largely been neglected so far.

We study the transfer learning process between two linear regression problems. An important and timely special case is when the regressors are overparameterized and perfectly interpolate their training data. We examine a parameter transfer mechanism whereby a subset of the parameters of the target task solution are constrained to the values learned for a related source task. We analytically characterize the generalization error of the target task in terms of the salient factors in the transfer learning architecture, i.e., the number of examples available, the number of (free) parametersineachofthetasks,thenumberofparameterstransferredfromthesourcetotargettask, and the relation between the two tasks. Our non-asymptotic analysis shows that the generalization errorofthetargettaskfollowsatwo-dimensional double descent trend(withrespecttothenumber of free parameters in each of the tasks) that is controlled by the transfer learning factors. Our analysis points to specific cases where the transfer of parameters is beneficial as a substitute for extraoverparameterization(i.e.,additionalfreeparametersinthetargettask). Specifically,weshow thattheusefulnessofatransferlearningsettingisfragileanddependsonadelicateinterplayamong the set of transferred parameters, the relation between the tasks, and the true solution.

Transfer learning [21] is a prominent strategy to address a machine learning task of interest using information and parameters already learned and/or available forarelatedtask. Suchdesignssignificantlyaidtrainingofoverparameterizedmodelslikedeep neural networks (e.g., [4, 24, 16]), which are inherently challenging due to the vast number of parameters compared to the number of training data examples. There are various ways to integrate the previously-learned information from the source task in the learning process of the target task; often this is done by taking subsets of parameters (e.g., layers in neural networks)learnedforthesourcetaskandpluggingtheminthetargettaskmodelasparameter subsetsthatcanbesetfixed, finelytuned, orserveasnon-randominitializationforathorough learning process. Obviously, transfer learning is useful only if the source and target tasks are sufficientlyrelatedwithrespecttothetransfermechanismutilized,e.g.,[23,29,13]. Moreover, finding a successful transfer learning setting for deep neural networks was shown in [22] to be a delicate engineering task. The importance of transfer learning in contemporary practice should motivate fundamental understanding of its main aspects via analytical frameworks that may consider linear structures (see, e.g., [14]). In general, the impressive success of overparameterized architectures for supervised learn- ing have raised fundamental questions on the classical role of the bias-variance tradeoff that guidedthetraditionaldesignstowardsseemingly-optimalunderparameterizedmodels[5].

We show that, up to the fourth order, the electrostatic-field-induced interatomic interaction is just the classical dipole-dipole interaction, which disagrees with the recent result from Fiscelli et al. [G. Fiscelli et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. <h2>124, </h2> 013604 (2020)]. However, to higher orders, there exist external-field-related quantum corrections to the induced classical electrostatic dipole-dipole interaction. In the sixth order, the external field effectively modifies the atomic polarizability to give rise to a two-photon-exchange quantum cor- rection, while in the eighth order, the external field enables an additional process of three-photon exchange which is not allowed in the absence of the external field, and this process generates an r\u221211 term in the interaction potential in the far regime, where r is the interatomic separation. Nu- merical estimations show that these external-field-related quantum corrections are much smaller than the two-photon-exchange Casimir-Polder interaction. \u2217 ys-hu@qq.com \u2020 Corresponding author. jwhu@hunnu.edu.cn \u2021 Corresponding author. hwyu@hunnu.edu.cn 1 "

Introduction The theory of large deviations studies the asymptotic tail behaviour of sequences of random variables. The earliest developments of this theory arose in the context of ruin theory in actuarial science [8, 9], while Varadhan and Donsker [13, 29] systematically developed the modern framework of this field. Next, we recall the basic principles of large deviations theory; we refer to the excellent monograph [12] for further details and historical background.

The superior temporal and spectral resolution, has brought forth pump-probe spectroscopy for ultrafast dynamic study of transient states in various intriguing materials, such as quantum materials, metamaterials, and plasmonic materials, by directly reporting spectroscopic complex response function, i.e., \ud835\udf50\u0303(\ud835\udf4e) using either time- or frequency-domain- based probes. In contrast to its frequency-domain counterparts, e.g., FTIR and ellipsometry, time-domain spectroscopy outstands by providing not only superb spectroscopic phase sensitivity but also exceptional temporal resolution due to its pulsed nature. To extend detection range of time-domain spectroscopy into the challenging visible frequencies, we propose an interferometry-type frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG). Our numerical simulation shows, when operating in a double-pulse scheme, a unique phase- locking mechanism can be activated, and therefore preserves both zero- and first-order phases (\ud835\udf4b ,\ud835\udf4b ), \ud835\udfce \ud835\udfcf that are otherwise inaccessible to standard FROG measurement. Followed by time-domain signal reconstruction and analysis protocol, we show that time-domain spectroscopy with sub-cycle temporal resolution is enabled and well suits the need of ultrafast-compatible and ambiguity-free method for complex dielectric function measurement at visible wavelengths. Time-domain spectroscopy (TDS), referring to a complete waveform mapping of oscillating electromagnetic pulse with sub-cycle temporal resolution, is an increasingly important tool for measurement of complex optical response functions, i.e., dielectric function \ud835\udf16\u0303(\ud835\udf14), optical conductivity \ud835\udf0e\u0303(\ud835\udf14) or refractive index \ud835\udc5b\u0303(\ud835\udf14), particularly at far-IR and mid-IR wavelengths. Ultrafast laser, emitting pulsed electromagnetic wave of femtosecond and even attosecond duration, renders remarkable temporal resolution and detection bandwidth, and, therefore, has been widely used for dynamic study of non-equilibrium states in complex materials [1\u20134], referred to as pump-probe spectroscopy [5]. Through light-matter interaction, an intensive pulse, known as pump beam, initiates non- equilibrium dynamics and is followed by a weaker pulse, known as probe beam, that reports on subsequent transient state at a delayed time [6,7]. One preeminent probing method, known as time-domain spectroscopy, has been increasingly important for such endeavor, without relying on Kramers-Kronig analysis that is otherwise required by rival frequency-domain technique, such as broadband FTIR and standard reflectance or transmittance measurement. Time-domain spectroscopy typically operates at far- and mid-IR range, i.e. THz and multi-THz frequencies, and maps out waveform of a target pulse \ud835\udc38(\ud835\udc61) with sub-cycle resolution by convolving its relatively slow oscillating field and another much shorter gate pulse via electro-optic sampling (EO-sampling).

The antiferromagnetic element Mn possesses a unique half-filled 3d electron structure, creating split virtual bound states near the Fermi energy level and producing a large local magnetic moment after vacancy formation. The resultant electron spin oscillations reduce the number of electrons involved in charge density oscillations, destroying charge screening and lowering potential interaction at the saddle point between the vacancy and diffusing atom. This ultimately facilitates vacancy diffusion by reducing energy level variations of conduction band electrons during the diffusion process. These findings offer valuable insights into atom diffusion mechanisms and open up new avenues for manipulating defect properties through unique element design, thereby enabling the creation of high-performance alloys in a broad range of fields. In the field of materials science, uncovering the intricate relationship between the structure and the physical properties, as well as discovering new laws, is the key to unlocking a deeper understanding of the subject. Since the Bronze Age, metal alloying has been used as a strategy to improve material properties [1]. Recent advancements in this field include Concentrated Solid-Solution Alloys (CSAs) and High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) [2-4], which offer exceptional properties that surpass those of traditional alloys. The high concentrations of multiple elements in these alloys provide a vast composition space, but also present a challenge in discovering the underlying physical mechanisms that govern their properties. The concept of \"sluggish\" diffusion [5], a core effect of HEAs, is hotly debated [6,7], with recent studies [8,9] suggesting that the type of elements in the alloy plays a greater role than configurational entropy. Additionally, the specific elements chosen in a CSA significantly affect the alloy's response to irradiation, hydrogen embrittlement, and other properties [10-12]. The movement of atoms in crystalline solids is often facilitated by vacancy point defects, making them a crucial factor in the diffusion process. As a result, the rate of microstructural evolution and phase transformations in CSAs is greatly influenced by the diffusivity of these vacancies. However, the complex local atomic environments make it difficult to 1 / 16 "

However, the challenges in fabricating photonic devices in diamond have limited its potential for use in quantum technologies. While various hybrid integration approaches have been developed for coupling diamond color centers with photonic devices defined in a heterogeneous material, these methods suffer from either large insertion loss at the material interface or evanescent light-matter coupling. Here, we present a new technique that enables deterministic assembly of diamond color centers in a silicon nitride photonic circuit. Using this technique, we observe Purcell enhancement of silicon vacancy centers coupled to a silicon nitride ring resonator. Our hybrid integration approach has the potential for achieving the maximum possible light-matter interaction strength while maintaining low insertion loss, and paves the way towards scalable manufacturing of large-scale quantum photonic circuits integrated with high-quality quantum emitters and spins.

Dennis, Andrew P. McGovern, Lauren R. Rodgers, Beverley M. Shields, William Henley & Jack Bowden on behalf of the MASTERMIND consortium </h1> <h1>July 2022 </h1> <h1>Abstract </h1> Observational studies can play a useful role in assessing the comparative effectiveness of competing treatments. In a clinical trial the randomization of participants to treatment and control groups generally results in well-balanced groups with respect to possible confounders, which makes the analysis straightforward. However, when analysing observational data, the potential for unmeasured confounding makes comparing treatment effects much more chal- lenging. Causal inference methods such as Instrumental Variable and Prior Even Rate Ratio approaches make it possible to circumvent the need to adjust for confounding factors that have not been measured in the data or measured with error. Direct confounder adjustment via multivariable regression and Propensity score matching also have considerable utility. Each method relies on a different set of assumptions and leverages different aspects of the data. In this paper, we describe the assumptions of each method and assess the impact of vio- lating these assumptions in a simulation study. We propose the prior outcome augmented Instrumental Variable method that leverages data from before and after treatment initia- tion, and is robust to the violation of key assumptions. Finally, we propose the use of a heterogeneity statistic to decide if two or more estimates are statistically similar, taking into account their correlation. We illustrate our causal framework to assess the risk of genital infection in patients prescribed Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors versus Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors as second-line treatment for Type 2 Diabets using observational data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.

Mathematicaljustificationsaregivenforseveralintegralandseries representations of the Dirac delta function which appear in the physics liter- ature. These include integrals of products of Airy functions, and of Coulomb wave functions; they also include series of products of Laguerre polynomials and of spherical harmonics. The methods used are essentially based on the asymptoticbehaviorofthesespecialfunctions. 1. Introduction The Dirac delta function \u03b4(x) has been used in physics well before the theory of distributions (generalized functions) was introduced by mathematicians. The manner in which physicists used this function was to define it by the equations (1.1) \u03b4(x\u2212a)=0, x(cid:54)=a, and (cid:90) \u221e (1.2) \u03c6(x)\u03b4(x\u2212a)dx=\u03c6(a), a\u2208R, \u2212\u221e for any continuous function \u03c6(x) on R. However, mathematically, these two equa- tions are inconsistent in the classical sense of a function and an integral, since the valueoftheintegralofafunctionwhichiszeroeverywhereexceptforafinitenumber ofpointsshouldbezero. Therearenowtwomathematicallymeaningfulapproaches to help us interpret the delta function given in (1.1)\u2212(1.2). One approach is to consider\u03b4 :=\u03b4(x\u2212a)asacontinuouslinearfunctionalactingonaspaceofsmooth a functions with rapid decay at \u00b1\u221e, and the action of \u03b4 on a particular function a \u03c6(x) is given the value \u03c6(a); see [14, p.141] and [15, p.77]. The other approach is to find a sequence of functions \u03b4 (x\u2212a) such that n (cid:90) \u221e (1.3) lim \u03b4 (x\u2212a)\u03c6(x)dx=\u03c6(a), a\u2208R; n n\u2192\u221e \u2212\u221e see [7, p.55] and [10, p.17]. Such a sequence is called a delta sequence and we write, symbolically, (1.4) lim \u03b4 (x\u2212a)=\u03b4(x\u2212a), x\u2208R. n n\u2192\u221e 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The paper develops a general theory of orderability of quandles with a focus on link quandlesof tame links and gives some general constructions of orderable quandles. We provethat knotquandlesofmanyfiberedprimeknotsareright-orderable,whereaslinkquandlesofmostnon- trivial torus links are not right-orderable. As a consequence, we deduce that the knot quandle of the trefoil is neither left nor right orderable. Further, it is proved that link quandles of certain non-trivial positive (or negative) links are not bi-orderable, which includes some alternating knots of prime determinant and alternating Montesinos links. The paper also explores interconnections between orderability of quandles and that of their enveloping groups. The results establish that orderability of link quandlesbehavequitedifferently than that of corresponding link groups. 1. Introduction It is known that existence of a linear order on a group has profound implications on its struc- ture. For instance, a left-orderable group cannot have torsion and a bi-orderable group cannot have even generalized torsion (product of conjugates of a non-trivial element being trivial). In terms of applicability, it is known that integral group rings of left-orderable groups have no zero- divisors. Recall that the famous Kaplansky\u2019s conjecture asserts this to be true for all torsion-free groups. Concerning groups arising in topology, the literature shows that many such groups are left-orderable. In fact, the fundamental group of any connected surface other than the projec- tive plane or the Klein bottle is bi-orderable [7]. Braid groups are the most relevant examples of left-orderable groups which are not bi-orderable [11]. On the other hand, pure braid groups are knowntobebi-orderable[14]. RourkeandWiest[30]extendedthisresultbyshowingthatmapping class groups of all Riemann surfaces with non-empty boundary are left-orderable. In general these groups are not bi-orderable. Orderability of 3-manifold groups has been investigated extensively where left-orderability is a rather common property. Concerning link complements, it is known that fundamental groups of link complements are left-orderable [7], whereas fundamental groups of not all link complements are bi-orderable [28]. For example, the knot group of the figure-eight knot is bi-orderable and the group of a non-trivial cable of an arbitrary knot is not bi-orderable. In general, a fibered knot has bi-orderable knot group if all the roots of its Alexander polynomial are real and positive [28]. Note that there are infinitely many such fibered knots. For more on the literature, we refer the reader to the recent monograph [9] by Clay and Rolfsen which explores orderability of groups motivated by topology, like fundamental groups of surfaces or 3-manifolds, braid and mapping class groups, groups of homeomorphisms, etc. Another monograph [12] on orderability of braid groups is worth looking into. Thenotionoforderability canbedefinedformagmasjustasforgroups.

The model lifts 2D pre-trained features to 3D using sensed depth, and attends to them to com- pute features for sampled 3D points. It samples 3D point grids in a coarse to fine manner, featurizes them using relative-position attention, and selects where tofocusthenextroundofpointsampling.

Many recent methods train neural manipulation policies to predict 3D end-effector pose sequences directly from 2D images using supervision from demon- strations[1,2,3,4,5,6].

Introduction and statement of results If <h2>E/Q </h2> is an elliptic curve, then a theorem of Hasse implies, for every prime p, that there exists \u03b8 (p) \u2208 [0,\u03c0] such that E \u221a <h2>#E(F </h2> ) = p+1\u22122 pcos(\u03b8 (p)). p E Around 1960, Sato and Tate independently conjectured that if E does not have complex multipli- cation and 0 \u2264 a < b \u2264 \u03c0, then #{p \u2264 N : \u03b8 (p) \u2208 [a,b]} 2 (cid:90) b lim E = <h2>sin2\u03b8d\u03b8. </h2> N\u2192\u221e N \u03c0 a Undersomeconditions,theSato-TateConjecturewasfamouslyprovedbyClozel,Harris,Shepherd- Barron, and Taylor in three joint papers [7],[13], and [22]. An unconditional proof was obtained in 2011 by Barnet-Lamb, Geraghty, Harris, and Taylor [4]. Thereareotherarithmeticquestionsthathavebeenconsideredaboutsuchangles.

It is shown what error is obtained from the assumption that the asymptotic density of a sequence of primes is a probability. Various forms of an analogue of the law of large numbers for arithmetic functions and, in particular, the Hardy-Ramunajan theorem are obtained. A method is given for finding asymptotics of the probabilistic characteristics of arithmetic functions. 1. INTRODUCTION It is said [1] that the theory of probability studies not only objects of a random nature, but also deterministic rather complex objects that are poorly described by other methods. The application of probability theory to number theory is studied by probabilistic number theory. We will look at two such complex deterministic objects: primes and arithmetic functions in this work. Indeed, the conjecture of infinity of twin primes has not yet been proved by methods of number theory, although Hardy and Littlewood gave an accurate estimate of their number using probabilistic methods. The picture is similar with other conjectures about prime numbers. The second chapter of this work will be devoted to one of the questions of the distribution of prime numbers. An arithmetic function is a function defined on the set of natural numbers and taking values on the set of complex numbers. The name arithmetic function is due to the fact that this function expresses some arithmetic property of the natural series. It is interestimg to study the distribution of arithmetic functions in the natural series. These issues are discussed in the third chapter of this work. Keywords: density of a subset of natural series, asymptotic density, arithmetic function, analogue of the law of large numbers, strongly additive arithmetic function, limit distribution function, standard function of normal distribution, asymptotic of probabilistic characteristics of arithmetic functions, sequence of random variables, independence of random variables, number of prime divisors of natural number 1 "

The attention module guides our model to fo- cus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target do- mains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previousattention-basedmethodwhichcannothandlethegeometricchangesbe- tween domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adap- tiveLayer-InstanceNormalization)functionhelpsourattention-guidedmodelto flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned param- eters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

We introduce a path-theoretic framework for understanding the representation theory of (quantum) symmetric and general linear groups and their higher level generalisations over fields ofarbitrarycharacteristic. Ourfirstmainresultisa\u201csuper-stronglinkageprinciple\u201dwhichprovides degree-wise upper bounds for graded decomposition numbers (this is new even in the case of sym- metric groups). Next, we generalise the notion of homomorphisms between Weyl/Specht modules which are \u201cgenerically\u201d placed (within the associated alcove geometries) to cyclotomic Hecke and diagrammatic Cherednik algebras. Finally, we provide evidence for a higher-level analogue of the classical Lusztig conjecture over fields of sufficiently large characteristic. Introduction CyclotomicquiverHeckealgebras(andtheirquasi-herediarycovers, thediagrammaticCherednik algebras) are of central interest in Khovanov homology, knot theory, group theory, and higher representation theory. Rouquier\u2019s conjecture [Rou08b] (recently solved in a flurry of publications [RSVV16, Los16, Web17]) allows us to understand the complex representation theory of these algebras in terms of Kazhdan\u2013Lusztig theory. This paper seeks to generalise their work to the modularrepresentationtheoryofthesealgebras,wherealmostnothingisknownorevenconjectured. Our approach provides new insight even in the classical case; in particular it allows us to provide strong new degree-wise upper bounds for the graded decomposition numbers of symmetric groups. This combinatorial bound is given in terms of folding-up paths in Euclidean space under the action of an affine Weyl group. This seems to be the first result of its kind in the literature, and so we state it now in this simplified form (for the full statement in higher levels, see Theorem 8.1). Theorem A (The Super-Strong Linkage Principle for symmetric groups). Let \u03bb,\u00b5 be partitions with at most h columns and k be a field of characteristic p > h. The graded decomposition numbers of the symmetric group are bounded as follows, [S(\u03bb) : D(\u00b5)(cid:104)k(cid:105)] (cid:54) |{s | s \u2208 <h2>Path+(\u03bb,t\u00b5),deg(s) </h2> = k}| (1) for k \u2208 <h2>Z. </h2> In particular if [S(\u03bb) : D(\u00b5)] (cid:54)= 0, then \u03bb and \u00b5 are strongly linked with \u03bb \u2191 \u00b5. TheoremAprovidesatwo-foldstrengtheningofthefamousstronglinkageprincipleforsymmetric (and general linear) groups [And80]. Firstly, if <h2>Path+(\u03bb,t\u00b5) </h2> (cid:54)= \u2205 this implies that \u03bb \u2191 \u00b5 and so we obtain infinitely many new zeroes of the decomposition matrix not covered by [And80, Theorem 1]. Secondly, equation (1) clearly provides a wealth of new and more complicated bounds on these multiplicities \u2013 in addition it incorporates the grading into the picture for the first time. We expect this result to be of independent interest and so we have included illustrative examples in Section 8. In the case of symmetric groups, it is common practice to restrict ones attention to the repre- sentations with at most h columns. In so doing, we obtain a category of representations which remains rich in structure but, thanks to revolutionary work of Riche\u2013Williamson [RW16], is now known to stabilise and become understandable over fields of characteristic p (cid:29) h. The princi- pal aim of this paper is to identify a higher level analogue of this category with a similarly rich structure and to generalise the vast array of powerful ideas and results developed by Andersen, Carter, Jantzen, Kleshchev, Koppinen, Lusztig and others over the past forty years (in particu- lar [And80, And98, CP80, Kop86, Kle97, Lus80, Jan77]) and hence cast questions concerning the representation theory of these higher level algebras in terms of their associated alcove geometries. The quotient algebra of the cyclotomic quiver Hecke algebra H (\u03ba) (and hence subcategory of n H (\u03ba)-mod) of interest to us is n Q (\u03ba) = H (\u03ba)/(cid:104)e(i) | i \u2208 <h2>I(cid:96) </h2> and i = i +1 for 1 (cid:54) k (cid:54) h(cid:105) (cid:96),h,n n k+1 k 1 <h1>8102 </h1> <h1>yaM </h1> 3 <h1>]TR.htam[ </h1> <h1>2v82170.6071:viXra </h1> "

It pro- poses estimators for the moments of the cross-sectional distribution of the autore- gressive (AR) coefficients, assuming a random coefficient model for the autoregressive coefficients without imposing any restrictions on the fixed effects. It is shown the stan- dard generalized method of moments estimators obtained under homogeneous slopes are biased. Small sample properties of the proposed estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and compared with a number of alternatives, both under homogeneous and heterogeneous slopes. It is found that a simple moment estimator of the mean of heterogeneous AR coefficients performs very well even for moderate sam- ple sizes, but to reliably estimate the variance of AR coefficients much larger samples are required. It is also required that the true value of this variance is not too close to zero. The utility of the heterogeneous approach is illustrated in the case of earnings dynamics.

Tungsten and its alloys are widely used in technologies as structural materials working under extreme conditions involving high mechanical and thermal influences [1\u20134]. An equation of state (EOS) for tungsten is of interest to use in hydrodynamic simulations of processes at high energy densities [5\u201311]. In this work, a caloric EOS P = P(V,E), which provides an adequate descriptionofthermodynamicpropertiesoftungstenincondensed-phasestatesoverawiderange \u22121 of densities and internal energies, is presented. Here, P is the pressure, V = \u03c1 is the specific volume, \u03c1 is the density, E is the specific internal energy. In contrast to the EOSs derived for this metal previously [12\u201319], a method [20] for calculation of the curve of cold compression at T = 0 K is used. The EOS model is formulated in the general form as \u0393(V,E) P(V,E) = P (V)+ [E <h2>\u2212E </h2> (V)], (1) c c V whereE (V)andP (V)= <h2>\u2212dE </h2> /dV arethecoldcomponentsofenergyandpressureatT =0K, c c c and \u0393(V,E) is a coefficient determining the contribution of thermal components of EOS.

A viable weak-field and slow-motion approximation method is constructed in F(R,R <h2>R\u00b5\u03bd,R R\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3) </h2> gravity, a general class of fourth-order theories of gravity.

The metric consists of the massless tensor part, the massive scalar part, and the massive tensor part, where the former is exactly the metric in General Relativity, and the latter two are the corrections to it. It is shown that the corrections bear the Yukawa-like dependence on the two massive parameters and predict the appearance of six additional sets of source multipole moments, which indicates that up to <h2>1/c3 </h2> order, there exist six degrees of freedom beyond General Relativity within F(R,R <h2>R\u00b5\u03bd,R R\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3) </h2> gravity.

In various problems in different fields we need to compare object as differ- ent as functions, images, geometric shapes, probability distributions, or text documents. Each such problem has its own notion of data similarity. A particularly challenging case of similarity arises in applications deal- ing with multimodal data, which have different representation, dimensional- ity, and structure.

This club generalizes the operad of associative rings by adding \u201camalga- mated\u201d products. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> There is a straightforward way to define operads in the monoidal category (Cat,\u00d7): just apply the standard definition. However, since Cat is not just a category, but a 2-category, such a definition is of very limitied value. For one thing, the action of symmetric groups through functors would not be the correct action in most applications. Instead, one would need symmetric groups to act by morphisms. In this paper we make use of another way, the 2-categorical structure of Cat makes itself felt.

In this paper, ourmain purpose is to study the existence problem for stable coherent systems on the projective line when the number of sections is largerthan the rank. We include a review of known results, mostly for a small number of sections. 1. Introduction We begin with a tribute to Sir Michael Atiyah by the first author, who says \u201cI was among the earliest of Sir Michael\u2019s students (actually, I think, the fourth) and owe the principal topic of my research, namely vector bundles on algebraic curves, to him. My first supervisor, John Todd, pointed me in the direction of vector bundles but the inspiration for my thesis and a large part of my subsequent work came from Michael. Two of his early papers [1, 2] were instrumental in this together with the work of M. S. Narasimhan and C. S. Seshadri [11, 12] to which he introduced me at a time when I was still groping for a topic for my thesis. He was a constant support during this period (1964/65) which I spent in Oxford. He also introduced me to David Mumford, who arranged for me to spend a productive year in Harvard. In large part, I owe my career to him and to an even earlier student of Michael\u2019s, Rolph Schwarzenberger, with whom I wrote my first paper. The current paper still falls within the area of vector bundles on algebraic curves.\u201d Coherent systems on an algebraic curve C of genus g are the higher rank analogue of linear systems and have been the subject of much study in the last 25 years. There is a concept of \u03b1-stability for coherent systems depending on a real number \u03b1, which must be positive for \u03b1-stable coherent systems to exist. Coherent systems arerelatedtohigherrankBrill-Noetherlociandhavegauge-theoreticandsymplectic interpretations; they are also closely related to holomorphic k-pairs. The survey [3] describes these relationships and includes relevant references. The study of coherent systems includes general results valid for any genus (see, for example, [4]). (There are surveys in [3] and [13], but these are by no means up to date.)

This classification is based on the topology of their workspace. The workspace is characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves of the manipulator. The workspace topology is defined by the number of cusps and nodes that appear on these singular curves. The design parameters space is shown to be partitioned into nine subspaces of distinct workspace topologies. Each separating surface is given as an explicit expression in the DH-parameters. Keywords: Classification, Workspace, Singularity, Cusp, node, orthogonal manipulator 1. Introduction This paper focuses on positioning 3R manipulators with orthogonal joint axes (orthogonal manipulators). Orthogonal manipulators may have different global kinematic properties according to their link lengths and joint offsets. Unlike usual industrial manipulators, orthogonal manipulators may be cuspidal, that is, they can change their posture without meeting a singularity (Parenti and Innocenti, 1988, Burdick, 1988). This property was unknown before 1988 (Borrel and Li\u00e9geois, 1988). Several years later, some conditions for a manipulator to be noncuspidal were provided, which include simplifying geometric conditions like parallel and intersecting joint axes (Burdick, 1995) and also nonintuitive conditions (Wenger, 1997). A general necessary and sufficient condition for a 3-DOF manipulator to be cuspidal was established in (El Omri and Wenger, 1995), namely, the existence of at least one point in the workspace where the inverse kinematics admits three equal solutions. The word \u201ccuspidal manipulator\u201d was defined in accordance to this condition because a point with three equal IKS forms a cusp in a cross section of the workspace (Arnold, 1981). The categorization of all generic 3R manipulators was established in (Wenger, 1998) based on the homotopy class of the singular curves in the joint space. Wenger, 1999 proposed a procedure to take into account the cuspidality property in the design process of new manipulators. More "

Inparticular,aweakGibbsmeasureforacontinuouspotential is a Gibbs measure for an asymptotically additive sequence. This allows, for example, to apply recent results on dimension theory of asymptotically ad- ditive sequences to study multifractal analysis for weak Gibbs measure for continuous potentials. 1. Introduction and Preliminaries Gibbs measures have played a prominent role in ergodic theory since the defini- tionwasbroughtfromstatisticalmechanicsintodynamicalsystems(seeforexample [Bow, Si]). Existence of Gibbs measures usually requires strong forms of hyperbol- icity on the system and of regularity on the potential. In her study of equilibrium measuresforintermittentintervalmaps,Yuri[Y1,Y2,Y3]introducedthenotionof weak Gibbs measure. It turns out that these measures, which generalize the clas- sical notion of Gibbs measures, exist under meagre regularity assumptions on the potential and for a wider class of dynamical systems. Technically, the main differ- encebetweenthe twonotionsis thatforGibbs measureswehaveauniformcontrol on the measure of dynamical balls while for weak Gibbs measures this control is not uniform (see Section 1.1 for precise statements). This circle of ideas has been generalizedtosettingsinwhichinsteadofconsideringasinglepotentialweconsider a sequence of potentials. This theory, usually called non-additive thermodynamic formalism, was introduced by Falconer [Fa1] with the purpose of studying dimen- siontheory of non-conformalsystems. We stressthat it is also a wellsuited theory to study products of matrices. The purpose of the present note is to show that a weak Gibbs measure for a potential is actually a Gibbs measure for a sequence of potentials. That point of view allows for the use of machinery developed to study Gibbs measures for sequences of potentials in the study of weak Gibbs measures for a single potential. As an example of the possibilities that are opened with this viewpoint we prove a variational principle for higher order multifractal analysis of weak Gibbs measures.

For those that host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the IMBH nature may be discerned through the accretion - jet activity. We present radio observations of four AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies (which potentially har- bor IMBHs). Very large array (VLA) observations indicate steep spectra (indices of \u22120.63 to \u22121.05) between 1.4 and 9GHz. A comparison with the 9GHz in-band spec- tral index however shows a steepening for GH047 and GH158 (implying older/relic emission) and flattening for GH106 and GH163 (implying recent activity). Overlapping emission regions in the VLA 1.4GHz and our very long baseline array (VLBA) 1.5GHz observations, and possibly symmetric pc-scale extensions are consistent with recent ac- tivity in the latter two. Using the compact VLBA radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity (probing the accretion activity) and the black hole masses, all AGNs are found to lie on the empirical fundamental plane relation. The four AGN are radio quiet with relatively higher Eddington ratios (0.04\u22120.32) and resemble the X-ray binaries during spectral state transitions that entail an outflow ejection.

ABSTRACT In this paper, we make a multi-epoch analysis of NGC1052, one of the prototypical LLAGN, using XMM-Newton, Suzaku and NuSTAR observations, taken from 2001 to 2017.

The second model presents a clumpy absorber. The reflection component is still present, but not the soft band power-law. Instead, absorption by a warm absorber is necessary to fit the spectra. This is the first time that a reflection component is established in this object, thanks to high energy data from NuSTAR. This component is constant in flux and shape, supporting the idea that is produced away from the central source (probably the torus). We find flux, spectral slope and absorption variations on timescales of months to years.

A modified asymptotic analysis method is employed to find the critical exponents \ud835\udefd and <h2>\ud835\udefe. </h2> We find that upon proton irradiation the critical exponents do not fall into any particular universality class but lie close to mean field critical exponents <h2>(\ud835\udefe </h2> = 1, \ud835\udefd = 0.5). The presence of long-range interactions can be safely assumed for the pristine and irradiated cases of MST examined in this work. Further analysis on the effective spatial dimensionality reveal that MST remains at \ud835\udc51 = 3 under proton irradiation transitioning from an \ud835\udc5b = 1 spin dimensionality to \ud835\udc5b = 2 and \ud835\udc5b = 3 for 1 \u00d7 <h2>1015 </h2> and 5 \u00d7 <h2>1015 H+/cm2, </h2> indicating an XY interaction and a Heisenberg interaction, respectively. The pair (spin-spin) correlation function reveals an increase in magnetic correlations at the proton irradiance of 5 \u00d7 <h2>1015 H+/cm2. </h2> In conjunction, the maximum change in magnetic entropy obtained from isothermal magnetization at 3 T is the largest for 5 \u00d7 <h2>1015 H+/cm2 </h2> with a value of 2.45 J/kg K at T = 73.66 K, in comparison to 1.60 J/kg K for pristine MST at T = 73 K. These results intriguingly align with the findings in previous work where magnetization (at 50 K, 3 T) increased by ~50 % at 5 \u00d7 <h2>1015 H+/cm2, </h2> in comparison to pristine MST [L. M. Martinez et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 116, 172404 (2020)]. Magnetic entropy derived from zero-field heat capacity does not show large deviations across the proton irradiated samples. This suggests that the antiferromagnetic coupling between the Mn sites is stable even after proton irradiation. Such result implies that magnetization is enhanced through a strengthening of the super-exchange interaction between Mn atoms mediated through Te rather than a weakening of the AFM component. Overall, our study finds that the magnetic interactions are manipulated the greatest when MST is irradiated at 5 \u00d7 <h2>1015 H+/cm2. </h2> * srao@utep.edu <h1>I.

The \u03bd = 6 gap can be describedbythermalexcitationtobroadenedLandaulevelswith awidthof400K.Incontrast,the gap measured at \u03bd = 2 is strongly temperature and field dependent and approaches the expected value for sharp Landau levels for fields B > 20 T and temperatures T > 100 K.

F. <h2>Kelton1 </h2> 1Department of Physics, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130, USA Almost three quarters of a century ago, Charles Frank proposed that the deep supercooling observed in metallic liquids is due to icosahedral short-range order (ISRO), which is incompatible with the long-range order of crystal phases. Some evidence in support of this hypothesis has been published previously. However, those studies were based on a small population of maximum supercooling measurements before the onset of crystallization. Here, the results of a systematic statistical study of several hundred maximum supercooling measurements on Ti Zr Ni and Zr Pt liquids are presented. Previous X-Ray and 39.5 39.5 21 80 20 neutron scattering studies have shown that the structures of these liquid alloys contain significant amounts of ISRO. The results presented here show a small work of critical cluster formation <h2>(W* </h2> = 31 \u2013 40 k T) B from the analysis of the supercooling data for the Ti Zr Ni liquid, which crystallizes to a metastable 39.5 39.5 21 icosahedral quasicrystal. A much larger value <h2>(W* </h2> = 60 \u2013 99 k T) was obtained for the Zr Pt liquid, B 80 20 which does not crystallize to an icosahedral quasicrystal. Taken together, these results significantly strengthen the validity of Frank\u2019s hypothesis. I.

First of all, starting from rather general assumptions, we predict the partial width of the decay. Then we analyze the effects of five possible new physics interactions, adopting in each case five different form factors. In particular, for each term beyond the standard model, we find some constraints on the strength and phase of the coupling, which we combine with those found by other authors in analyzing the analogous semi-leptonic decays of B. Our analysis involves some dimensionless quantities, substantially independent of the form factor, but which, owing to the constraints, turn out to be strongly sensitive to the kind of non-standard interaction. We also introduce a criterion thanks to which one can discriminate among the various new physics terms: the left-handed current and the two-higgs-doublet model appear privileged, with a neat preference for the former interaction. Lastly, we suggest a differential observable that could, in principle, help to distinguish between the two cases.

I. INTRODUCTION The Internet of Things (IoT) has become an emerging trend for its extraordinary potential to connect heterogeneous devicesandenablethemwithnewcapabilities[1].Manyreal- worldIoTapplicationsutilizemultiplesensorstocollectinfor- mation over the course of time, constituting multi-sensor time series data [2]\u2013[4]. These applications often leverage edge- based machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze locally collected data and perform various learning tasks. However, a critical issue across data-driven ML approaches, including deep neural networks (DNNs), is distribution shift. In partic- ular, the excellent performance of these ML algorithms relies heavily on the critical assumption that the training and infer- ence data are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.); i.e., they come from the same distribution [5]. Unfortunately, this assumption can be easily violated in real-world scenarios and have shown to substantially degrade model performance inmanyembeddedMLapplications,whereinstancesfromun- seendomainsnotfittingthedistributionofthetrainingdataare inevitable [6]\u2013[8]. For instance, in the field of mobile health, <h1>gnidocnE </h1> Prediction Similarity HDCModel Fig.1. AnOverviewofBrainCerebellumCortexandHDCClassification models can systematically fail when tested on patients from different hospitals or people from diverse demographics [9]. A number of innovative domain generalization (DG) tech- niques have been proposed for deep learning (DL) [10], [11]. However,duetotheirweaknotionofmemorization,theseDL approaches often fail to perform well on noisy multi-sensor time series data with spatial and temporal dependencies [12]. Recurrentneuralnetworks(RNNs),e.g.,longshort-termmem- ory (LSTM), have recently been proposed to address this issue [13]\u2013[15]. Nevertheless, these models are notably com- plicatedandinefficienttotrain,andtheirintricatearchitectures require substantial off-chip memory and computational power to iteratively refine millions of parameters over multiple time periods[15].Suchresource-intensiverequirementscanbeim- practical for less powerful computing platforms. Considering the massive amount of information nowadays, the power and memory limitations of embedded devices, and the potential instabilities of IoT systems, a more lightweight, efficient, and scalable learning framework to combat the distribution shift issue in multi-sensor time series data are of critical need. In contrast to traditional AI methodologies, brain-inspired Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) incorporates learning capability along with typical memory functions of stor- ing/loading information, and hence brings unique advantages in dealing with time-series data [16]. Additionally, HDC pro- vides a powerful learning solution for today\u2019s edge platforms byprovidingnotablyfastconvergence,highcomputationalef- ficiency,ultra-robustness againstnoises,and lightweighthard- ware implementation [17]\u2013[19]. As demonstrated in Fig. 1(a), HDC is motivated by the neuroscience observation that the cerebellum cortex in human brains effortlessly and efficiently process memory, perception, and cognition information with- out much concern for noisy or broken neuron cells. Closely mimicking the information representation and functionalities of human brains, HDC encodes low-dimensional inputs to <h1>3202 </h1> <h1>guA </h1> <h1>81 </h1> <h1>]GL.sc[ </h1> <h1>2v59230.8032:viXra </h1> "

INTRODUCTION Trinified models, SU(3) \u00d7SU(3) \u00d7SU(3) , are attractive candidates for a more symmetric extension of the C L R Standard Model (SM) as all matter can be arranged in bi-fundamental representations; no adjoint Higgs representa- tionsareneededtobreakthesymmetrytotheStandardModel;andgaugeinteractionsconservebaryonnumber,thus proton decay is naturally suppressed [1, 2]. Moreover, trinified models can be motivated as the low energy limit of stringtheory,bothasasubgroupofE inheteroticstringtheory[3]andN =8supergravity[4]aswellasinIIBstring 8 theoriesviaAdS/CFTdualitywithaconformalSU(3)n gaugetheory(seee.g.[5\u20137])1.Agenericproblemarisinginall theorieswhichaimatunifyingthegaugeinteractionsatsomelargeunificationscaleM isthehierarchyproblem:the U large hierarchy between the unification and the electroweak scale is unstable against radiative corrections. The most popularwayoutistointroduceweak-scalesupersymmetrywhichgivesrisetothecancellationofradiativecorrections ofSMparticlesandtheirsuperpartners.TheadditionalparticlecontentcanensuregaugecouplingunificationatM ; U moreover, there exists also a natural dark matter candidate. Alternatives of supersymmetry which adress at least some of these points and in particular the hierarchy problem include theories with large extra dimensions [11\u201314], a large number of copies of the SM states [15] or models based on AdS/CFT complementarity [5]. In such scenarios the Planck scale is typically lowered to the electroweak scale, avoiding any high energy scale in the theory. As we will see, the extension of trinified models with either of these ideas leads to important consequences for the mechanism of neutrino mass generation, namely the absence of a large seesaw scale and the necessity to generate neutrino masses at the TeV scale. In this paper we study the implementation of TeV neutrino mass generation via an inverse seesaw mechanism and some of its phenomenological consequences. We will show that in general, neutrino masses can be generated in the desired range. II. A SHORT REVIEW ON MINIMAL TRINIFICATION We begin by briefly reviewing the trinified model [1, 2, 16, 17].

In the flavor basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal, the (effective) neutrino mass matrix M has nine free parameters: three masses (m , m and m ), \u03bd 1 2 3 three mixing angles (\u03b8 , \u03b8 and \u03b8 ) and three phases (two Majorana-type \u03c1, \u03c3 and one Dirac-type \u03b4). x y z Experimentaldata [2,3,4,5]put constraintsonthe values ofthe massesandthe mixingangles;whereas no definite experimental measurements of the phases exist up till now. The recent global analysis of oscillation data[6] that includes the latest T2K[7] and MINOS[8] results reveals a relatively large value for the mixing angle \u03b8 , in contrast with the old global analysis[9] that was consistent with vanishing z \u03b8 . The Daya Bay experiment [10] confirm the non-vanishing \u03b8 and is in agreement with the findings z z of [6]. This in turn opens the door for studying the CP violation in neutrino oscillations with profound implications for our understanding of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The non-vanishing \u03b8 provide a guaranteed, albeit small, contribution to the third neutrino mass m for both single and z 3 double beta decay searches that must be accounted for in detailed analysis. From a theoretical point of view, the relatively large mixing angle \u03b8 may call for new ideas in model building. z \u2217elashin@ictp.it \u2020nchamoun@th.physik.uni-bonn.de 1 "

Concentric ring targets of the materials (in order from front to back targets: Au, TiO , Zn, Os, and Au) were 2 irradiated at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Source (HI\u03b3S). As a proof of principle, we report the result of the cross section measurements from the front Au target.

There are a number of different phenomena in the early universe that have to be stud- ied numerically with lattice simulations. This paper presents a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated Python program called PyCOOL that solves the evolution of scalar fields in a lattice with very precise symplectic integrators. The program has been written with the intention to hit a sweet spot of speed, accuracy and user friendliness. This has been achieved by using the Python language with the PyCUDA interface to make a program that is easy to adapt to different scalar field models. In this paper we derive the symplec- tic dynamics that govern the evolution of the system and then present the implementation of the program in Python and PyCUDA. The functionality of the program is tested in a chaotic inflation preheating model, a single field oscillon case and in a supersymmetric cur- vaton model which leads to Q-ball production. We have also compared the performance of a consumer graphics card to a professional Tesla compute card in these simulations. We find that the program is not only accurate but also very fast. To further increase the use- fulness of the program we have equipped it with numerous post-processing functions that provide useful information about the cosmological model. These include various spectra and statistics of the fields. The program can be additionally used to calculate the gener- ated curvature perturbation. The program is publicly available under GNU General Public License at https://github.com/jtksai/PyCOOL.

For reasonable priors, our analysis gives a probability of 72% that MARVELS- 6b has a mass below the hydrogen-burning limit of 0.072 M\u2299, and thus it is a high-confidence BD companion. It has a moderately long orbital period of 47.8929+0.0063 days with a low eccentricty of \u22120.0062 <h2>0.1442+0.0078, </h2> and a semi-amplitude of <h2>1644+12 </h2> m <h2>s\u22121. </h2> Moderate resolution spectroscopy of the host \u22120.0073 \u221213 star has determined the following parameters: T = 5598\u00b163, logg = 4.44\u00b10.17, and [Fe/H] = eff +0.40\u00b10.09. Based upon these measurements, GSC 03546-01452has a probable mass and radius of M\u2217 = 1.11\u00b10.11 M\u2299 and R\u2217 = 1.06\u00b10.23 R\u2299 with an age consistent with less than \u223c6 Gyr at a distance of 219 \u00b1 21 pc from the Sun. Although MARVELS-6b is not observed to transit, we cannot definitivelyruleoutatransitingconfigurationbasedonourobservations. Thereisavisualcompanion detected with Lucky Imaging at <h2>7.7\u2032\u2032 </h2> from the host star, but our analysis shows that it is not bound tothis system.

It also exists in an underdense region in both period/eccentricity and metallicity/eccentricity space.

In this paper, we first investigate the parameter estimation of eccentric GWs with decihertz observatory. We consider two scenarios for the configuration of DECIGO, i.e., the one cluster of DECIGO with its design sensitivityandB-DECIGOwhichalsohasoneclusterbutwithinferiorsensitivityasacomparison.

The precise 0 localization of binary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron star\u2013black hole binaries (NSBH), together with the large improvement of localization of BBH from eccentricity in the mid-band, inspire us to constructthecatalogsofgoldendarksirenswhosehostgalaxiescanbeuniquelyidentified.

Such an increase of 0 0 population of golden dark BBH events can improve the precision of Hubble constant measurement from 2.06% to 0.68%, matter density parameter from 64% to 16% in \u039bCDM model. Through the phenomenological parameterization of GW propagation, the constraints of modified gravity can be improved from 6.2% to 1.6%. Our results show the remarkable significance of eccentricity for the detection and parameter estimation of GW events, allowing us to probe the Universe precisely. I.

ABSTRACT Intrinsic alignments of galaxies are a significant astrophysicalsystematic affecting cosmologicalconstraintsfromweakgravitationallensing.Obtainingnumericalpre- dictionsfromhydrodynamicalsimulationsofexpectedsurveyvolumesisexpensive, and a cheaper alternative relies on populating large dark matter-only simulations with accurate models of alignments calibrated on smaller hydrodynamical runs. This requires connecting the shapes and orientations of galaxies to those of dark matterhaloesandtothelarge-scalestructure.Inthispaper,wecharacterisegalaxy- haloalignmentsintheHorizon-AGNcosmologicalhydrodynamicalsimulation.We compare the shapes and orientations of galaxies in the redshift range 0 < z < 3 to those of their embedding dark matter haloes, and to the matching haloes of a twin dark-matter only run with identical initial conditions. We find that galaxy ellipticitiesingeneralcannotbepredicteddirectlyfromhaloellipticities.Themean misalignment angle between the minor axis of a galaxy and its embedding halo is a function of halo mass, with residuals arising from the dependence of alignment on galaxy type, but not on environment. Haloes are much more strongly aligned among themselves than galaxies, and they decrease their alignment towards low redshift. Galaxy alignments compete with this effect, as galaxies tend to increase their alignment with haloes towards low redshift. We discuss the implications of these results for current halo models of intrinsic alignments and suggest several avenues for improvement.

Collaborative Innovation Center of Extreme Optics, Shanxi University, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, P. R. China Abstract Dynamic control of circular dichroism in photonic structures is critically important for compact spectrometers, stereoscopic displays, and information processing exploiting multiple degrees of freedom. Metasurfaces can help miniaturize chiral devices but only produce static and limited chiral responses. While external stimuli are able to tune resonances, their modulations are often weak, and reversing continuously the sign of circular dichroism is extremely challenging. Here, we demonstrate dynamically tunable chiral response of resonant metasurfaces supporting chiral bound states in the continuum combining them with phase- change materials. Phase transition between amorphous and crystalline phases allows to control chiral response and vary chirality rapidly from \u22120.947 to +0.958 backward and forward via chirality continuum. Our demonstrations underpin the rapid development of chiral photonics and its applications. 1 "

Our main result shows that the monotone modal \u00b5-calculus corresponds ex- actly to the fragment of this second-order language that is invariant for neighborhood bisimulations. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> The modal \u00b5-calculus was introduced, in its present form, by D. Kozen in [7]. It functions as a general specification language for labelled transition systems, encompassing many systems used in formal verification of processes, including propositionaldynamic logic (PDL) and many temporallogics,like computation- tree logic (CTL). In fact, any logic for labelled transition systems that is in- variant for bisimulation, and that can be translated into monadic second order logic, can be seen as a fragment of the \u00b5-calculus. This is due to the Janin- Walukiewicz theorem [6], which states that the modal \u00b5-calculus captures ex- actly the bisimulation invariant fragment of monadic second-order logic. This result is the counterpart for the \u00b5-calculus of van Benthem\u2019s characterization theoremforbasicmodallogic[1],whichisolatesmodallogicasthebisimulation invariant fragment of first-order logic. In this paper, we consider the modal \u00b5-calculus for monotone neighborhood structures, rather than labelled transition systems. Monotone neighborhood structuresare a generalizationofKripkeframes that areused to give semantics for modal logics that do not satisfy the distribution law for conjunctions: (cid:3)(\u03d5\u2227\u03c8)\u2194((cid:3)\u03d5\u2227(cid:3)\u03c8) With monotone neighborhood semantics, this equivalence is weakened to the implication from left to right. One good example of an application of this is alternating-time temporal logic, which is useful to reason about state-based 1 "

The main result here is that a simple separable C\u2217-algebra is Z-stable (where Z denotes the Jiang-Su algebra) if (i) it has finite nuclear dimension or (ii) it is approximately subhomogeneous with slow dimension growth.

Introduction The program to classify unital, simple, separable, nuclear C\u2217-algebras has re- cently seen a small paradigm shift [13]. In light of the fact that there exist such C\u2217-algebrasthat cannotbe classifiedby orderedK-theoryandtraces [34], the cur- renttrendistotrytoidentify,usingregularityproperties,theC\u2217-algebraswhichare (or should be) classifiable. This idea is crystallizedin a conjecture (cf. [36, Section 3.5]), due to Andrew Toms and Wilhelm Winter, that among these C\u2217-algebras, the following properties are equivalent: (i) finite nuclear dimension (defined in [44]); (ii) Z-stability (being isomorphic to one\u2019s tensor product with the Jiang-Su algebra Z, introduced in [18]); and (iii) almost unperforated Cuntz semigroup. Onemightalsoaddthat,modulotheUCT,conditions(i)-(iii)shouldbeequivalent to being classifiable (though in this form, such a statement is not well-formed because classifiability is a property of a class of C\u2217-algebras,and not a property of a single C\u2217-algebra). At the same time, certain examples of simple, stably projectionless C\u2217-algebras haveemerged\u2014includingcertaincrossedproductsofO <h2>byR </h2> [21],anuclear,sep- 2 arable, non-Z-stable example [31, Theorem 4.1], and others [12, 17, 37]. Certain tools, old and new, already allow one to understand some of the structure of these algebrasunderspecialhypotheses[6,27]. However,mostofthetheoryonregularity properties for C\u2217-algebras was developed only in the unital case, and leads one to ask what obstructions (if any) exist with nonunital algebras. Certainly, the unital case carries with it a number of simplifications: for instance, the simplex of traces on a C\u2217-algebra which take the value 1 at the unit (i.e. which are states) plays an indispensible roleinthe theory,anditisfarfromobviouswhatthe correctreplace- mentisinthenonunitalcase. Nonetheless,onehopesthatthesimplificationsinthe unital case are superficial, and that ultimately, one can find and prove analogues or generalizations of the known unital results. 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 46L35,46L80, 46L05,47L40,46L85.

The role of the axial U(1) breaking Kobayashi-Maskawa-\u2019t Hooft interaction on the low-lying thermal excitations is examined. At low temperatures, only mesonic correlations, mainly due to low mass mesonic collective excitations, pions and kaons, dominate the pressure while thermal excitations of quarks are suppressed by the Polyakov loop. As temperature increases, kaons and pions melt into the continuum of quark andanti-quark excitations successively sothathadronicphasechanges continuously to the quark phase where quark excitations dominate pressure together with gluon pressure coming from the effective potential for the Polyakov loop. Since we intro- duce mesons as not elementary fields but auxiliary fields made from quarks, we can describe the phase transition between hadronic phase and quark phase in a unified fashion. 1 Introduction This is a sequel to our recent paper[1]. We first briefly summarize the basic motivation of these works before presenting the aim of the present work. QCD phase transitions in hot and dense matter has been a focus of intense research in modern nuclear physics[2,3,4] . We all expect that at low temper- atures the chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously and all colored objects, including quarks, are confined in color-singlet hadrons, while at high enough temperature the chiral symmetry is restored and the color-confinement is lost, "

Sandersea aCentrumWiskunde & Informatica,Science Park 123, Amsterdam, The Netherlands bDelftUniversity of Technology, Process and Energy, Leeghwaterstraat 39, Delft, The Netherlands Abstract A novel hyper-reduction method is proposed that conserves kinetic energy and momentum for reduced order models of the incompressible Navier-Stokesequations. The main advantage of conservationof kinetic energy is that it endows the hyper-reduced order model (hROM) with a nonlinear stability property. The new method poses the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) as a minimization problem and subsequently imposes constraints to conserve kinetic energy. Two methods are proposed to improve the robustness of the new method against error accumulation: oversampling and Mahalanobis regularization. Mahalanobisregularizationhas the benefit of not requiring additional measurement points. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed to perform structure-preserving temporal localization with the principle interval decomposition: new interface conditions are derived such that energy and momentum are conserved for a full time-integration instead of only during separate intervals. The performance of the new structure- preserving hyper-reduction methods and the structure-preservingtemporal localization method is analysed usingtwoconvection-dominatedtestcases;ashear-layerroll-upandtwo-dimensionalhomogeneousisotropic turbulence. It is found that both Mahalanobis regularization and oversampling allow hyper-reduction of these test cases. Moreover, the Mahalanobis regularization provides comparable robustness while being more efficient than oversampling.

Introduction Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an integralpart of many modern engineering applica- tions. The increase in computational power in recent decades has allowed engineers to model increasingly larger fluid dynamical systems. However, many modern applications are of a multi-query or real-time na- ture e.g.designoptimization[68]anduncertainty quantification[28] or real-timecontrol[67,60]anddigital twin technology [37]. These applications still pose prohibitively large computational costs. Reduced order models (ROMs) have been proposed as a solution to this problem. A ROM is a type of surrogate model that approximates the high-dimensional full scale model, or full order model (FOM), in a low-dimensional wayby finding approximateformulations of involvedquantities or operators. The low-dimensionalityof the model consequently makes the ROM significantly cheaper to evaluate than the FOM. TraditionallyintheCFDcommunity,theseROMshavebeenconstructedbyprojectingthefluiddynamics equationsofinterestontolow-dimensionallinearspacesobtainedfromthe properorthogonaldecomposition (POD)algorithm[40,79],usingeitherGalerkin[73,67,81,43,53]orPetrov-Galerkin[17,35,16]projection.

Many recent PU methods are based on neural networks, but little has been done to develop boosting algorithms for PU learning, despite boosting algorithms\u2019 strong performance on many fully supervised classification problems. In this paper, we propose a novel boosting algorithm, AdaPU, for PU learning. Similarly to AdaBoost, AdaPU aims to optimize an empirical exponential loss, but the loss isbasedon the PUdata, ratherthan on positive-negative (PN) data. As in AdaBoost, we learn a weighted combination of weak classifiers by learning one weak classifier and its weight at a time. However, AdaPU requires a very different algorithm for learning the weak classifiers and determining their weights. This is because AdaPU learns a weak classifier and its weight using a weighted positive-negative (PN) dataset with some negative data weights \u2014 the dataset is derived from the original PU data, and the data weights are determined by the current weighted classifier combination, but some data weights are negative. Our experiments showed that AdaPU outperforms neural networks on several benchmark PU datasets, including a large-scale challenging cyber security dataset. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning [5, 4, 6] has recently attracted significant interest as an im- portant machine learning problem. While traditional supervised binary classification considers learning from both positive and negative examples, PU learning considers learning from only positive and unlabeled examples, where an unlabeled example can be either positive (P) or negative (N). PU learning arises naturally in various domains where positive (P) data and unlabeled (U) data are readily available, but obtaining negative examples is costly.

Theprimaryobjectiveistounderstandtheprogressionfrom normal hematopoiesis to the chronic and accelerated-acute phases in myeloid leukemia. The model incorporates intrinsic cellular division events in hematopoiesis and delineates the evolution of chronic myeloid leukemia into six compartments: cycling stem cells, quiescent stem cells, progenitor cells, differentiated cells, and terminally differentiated cells. Our anal- ysis reveals the existence of three distinct steady states within the dynamical system, representing normal hematopoiesis, the chronic phase, and the accelerated-acute stage of the disease. We investigate the local and global stability of these steady states and provide a characterization of the hematopoietic states based on this analysis. Additionally, numerical simulations are included to illustrate the theoretical results.

Namely, the bundles in the complexes are supposed to be of finite rank. (See Hodge [24] and Palais [52].) Under these two assumptions, elements of the complexes can be decomposed into closed, co-closed and harmonic parts uniquely. It follows that cohomology groups of the complexes are bijectively representable by har- monicelements. Moreover,theyarefinitedimensionalvectorspaces. Thestudy of elliptic complexes has a long history which goes back to W. Hodge and G. de Rham. See Maurin [46] and also Klein [29] for references and for the (pre- )history of this subject. Elliptic complexes are studied also in areas \u2018extrater- ritorial\u2019 to differential geometry and global analysis or in cases violating the compactness. SeeTsaiatal.

The Lengyel model overpredicts the necessary argon concentrations for LFS divertor detachment by about a factor of 5 \u2013 10 relative to the SOLPS- ITER simulations. Therefore, while the Lengyel model predicts that plasmas with accetable divertor heat loads in EU-DEMO would exceed the tolerable upstream impurity concentrations by a large margin, there are several SOLPS-ITER solutions within an acceptable operational space. The SOLPS-ITER simulations indicate that, unlike assumed by the standard Lengyel model, there are significant heat dissipation mechanisms other than argon radiation, such as cross-field transport, that reduce the role of argon radiation by a factor of 2 to 3. Furthermore, the Lengyel model assumes that the radiation front is powered by parallel heat conduction only, whichtendstoleadtoanarrowradiationfrontastheradiativeefficiencyincreasesstronglywith reducingthermalconductivity. Asaresult,theradiativevolumeandtotalimpurityradiationare suppressed for a given impurity concentration. However, the SOLPS-ITER simulations indicate that other mechanisms, such as cross-field transport, can compete with parallel heat conduction within the radiative front and increase the radiative volume. Due to these findings, usage of the standard Lengyel model for analyzing scaling between divertor conditions and configurations for devices such as EU-DEMO is strongly discouraged.

As a consequence, many XML data warehouse modelshavebeenproposedduringpastyearsinordertohandlehetero- geneity and complexity of multidimensional data in a way traditional relational data warehouse approaches fail to achieve. However, XML- nativedatabasesystemscurrentlysufferfromlimitedperformance,both intermsofvolumesofmanageabledataandqueryresponsetime. There- fore, recent research efforts are focusing theattention on fragmentation techniques, which are able to overcome the limitations above. Derived horizontal fragmentation is already used in relational data warehouses, and can definitely be adapted to the XML context. However, classical fragmentationalgorithmsarenotsuitabletocontrolthenumberoforig- inatedfragments,whichinsteadplaysacriticalroleindatawarehouses, and,withmoreemphasis,distributeddatawarehousearchitectures. In- spired by this research challenge, in this paper we propose the use of K-means clustering algorithm for effectively and efficiently supporting thefragmentationofverylargeXMLdatawarehouses,and,atthesame time, completely controlling and determining the number of originated fragments via adequately setting the parameter K. We complete our analytical contribution by means of a comprehensive experimental as- sessment where we compare the efficiency of our proposed XML data warehouse fragmentation technique against those of classical derived horizontal fragmentation algorithms adapted toXML datawarehouses. 1 Introduction Nowadays, XML has become a standard for representing complex business data [19], so that decision support processes that make use of XML data sources Copyright (cid:13)c 2009 InderscienceEnterprises Ltd.

Graph Mining Link Prediction Evaluation Methodology <h1>1 Introduction </h1> The structural particularities of graphs (i.e., networks) has motivated the design of specific machine learning methods for processing this type of data.

The characterization of graph mining algorithms is relevant, not only because graphs represent datainaratheruniqueway,butbecausetheyarealsoabletocaptureadifferenttypeofinformation. While traditional table representations of entity/value pairs naturally capture intra-entity patterns, andsodoestraditionalmachinelearning,networkdatacapturesmostlyinter-entity patterns.

While roton dispersion relations had been restricted to correlated quantum systems at low temperature, recent works show the possibility of obtaining this unusual dispersion in acoustic and elastic metamaterials. Such phenomenon has been demonstrated in periodic structures by means of beyond- nearest-neighbor interactions, following the formulation firstly developed by Brillouin in the (cid:48)50s. In this paper, we demonstrate both numerically and experimentally that beyond-nearest-neighbor connections are not a necessary condition to obtain this unusual dispersion relation in elasticity.

Introduction Elasticandacousticwavemanipulationthroughtheuseofmetamaterialsandphononic crystals has been received increasing attention in the last two decades thanks to the exotic and non common dynamic properties of such structures. While early designs were based on Bragg scattering or local resonance to create wide and low-frequency band-gaps [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], consideration is now transitioning to more complete forms of wave control, including energy focusing and amplification [7, 8, 9], wave filtering [10], beam-splitting [11], robust signal communication[12,13]andlocalization[14]usingconceptsfromtopologicalinsulators [15, 16, 17]. The possibility to control wave energy is always related to the design of properly engineered dispersion relations, with the concurrent creation of band- gaps and peculiar eigenstates. In topologically based metamaterials, protected edge (or interfacial) surface states are achieved by leveraging broken symmetries in time [18,19,20]orspace[12,21,21],emulatingtheQuantumHall(QHE)orQuantumSpin Hall (QSHE) effects. In graded-based systems, band-gaps are spatially controlled to emulate lensing or rainbow effects for signal amplification [9, 22] or energy conversion [23,24]. Broadlyspeaking,alargenumberofstudieshavebeendevotedtoshapingthe wave dispersion curves, creating phononic, locally resonant or topological band-gaps, often combined together to obtain unusual behaviors. <h1>2202 </h1> <h1>voN </h1> <h1>71 </h1> <h1>]hp-ssalc.scisyhp[ </h1> <h1>1v13490.1122:viXra </h1> "

Because most workloads can typically run most efficiently on certain types of cores, mapping tasks on the best available resources can not only save energy but also deliver high performance. However, optimal task scheduling for performance and/or energy is yet to be solved for heterogeneous platforms. The work presented herein mathematically formulates the optimal heterogeneous system task scheduling as an optimization problem using queueing theory. We analytically solve for the common case of two processor types, e.g., CPU+GPU, and give an optimal policy (CAB). We design the GrIn heuristic to efficiently solve for near-optimal policy for any number of processor types (within 1.6% of the optimal). Both policies work for any task size distribution and processing order, and are therefore, general and practical. We extensively simulate and validate the theory, and implement the proposed policy in a CPU-GPU real platform to show the optimal throughput and energy improvement. Comparing to classic policies like load-balancing, our results range from 1.08x~2.24x better performance or 1.08x~2.26x better energy efficiency in simulations, and 2.37x~9.07x better performance in experiments.

For power-law distributed compartment sizes, we calculate exact and asymptotic values of the ensemble averaged mean squared displacement and find that it increases subdiffusively, as either a power or the logarithm of time. Numerical simulations show that the probability density function of the displacement is non-Gaussian. We discuss the relevance of the model for the analysis of single-particle tracking experiments and its relation to other sources of subdiffusion.

Serpico Physics Department, Theory Division, CERN, CH-1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland (Dated: October24, 2018) Based on general considerations rather than model-dependent fits to specific scenarios, we argue thatanincreasewithenergyofthepositronfractionincosmicrays,suggestedbyseveralexperiments at E > \u223c 7GeV, most likely requires a primary source of electron-positron pairs.

INTRODUCTION 1 Sincelongtime,thestudyofthepositron/electronratio in cosmic rays has been recognized as an important tool toconstraintheproductionandpropagationofenergetic particles in the Galaxy and in the Solar System. The PAMELA satellite detector, which began its three-year 0.1 mission in June of 2006, is designed to measure (among othercomponents)thespectraofcosmicraypositronsup to270GeVandelectronsupto2TeV,eachwithunprece- dented precision [1].

A similar trend was in fact also in- dicated by earlier experiments, including HEAT [3] and AMS-01 [4], although with lesser statistical significance and over a smaller dynamical range. The behavior that seems to emerge in the positron fractionis verydifferent from that predicted for secondary positrons produced in the collisionsofcosmicraynuclideswiththe inter-stellar medium (ISM). The situation is summarized in Fig 1. While unaccountedsystematics inthe measurementsare inprinciplepossible,wethink itis worthreviewingwhat kindofphysicsmayleadto suchanenergyspectrum; we shall argue that by far the simplest and most likely (as- tro)physicalinterpretationisthatanadditional,primary source of high energy positrons exists. The positron fraction is defined as \u03a6 1 f(E)\u2261 e+ = , (1) \u03a6 e+ +\u03a6 e\u2212 1+(\u03a6 e\u2212/\u03a6 e+) where the fluxes \u03a6 refer to the ones at the top of the i atmosphere.

Thisisasurveyofsome recentresults relatingKhovanov\u2019sarc algebra to category O for Grassmannians, the general linear supergroup, and the walled Brauer algebra. The exposition emphasizes an extension of Young\u2019s orthogonal form for level two cyclotomic Heckealgebras. 1. Introduction This article is primarily intended as a survey of some of my recent joint re- sults with Catharina Stroppel from [BS1]\u2013[BS5]. In that work, we exploited the isomorphism constructed in [BK3] between level two cyclotomic quotients of certain affine Hecke algebras and quiver Hecke algebras to establish some re- markable connections between Khovanov\u2019s arc algebra from [K], the Bernstein- Gelfand-Gelfand category O for Grassmannians, the general linear supergroup GL(m|n), and the walled Brauer algebra B (\u03b4). Our results can be viewed as r,s an application of some of the ideas emerging from the development of higher representation theory by Khovanov and Lauda [KL] and Rouquier [R2]; see the recent survey [S2] which adopts this point of view. We are going to approach the subject instead from a more classical direction, focussing primarily on a certain extension of Young\u2019s orthogonal form for level two Hecke algebras. This orthogonal form is really the technical heart of the paper [BS3] but it is quite well hidden. We will also explain its q-analogue not mentioned at all there. The level two Hecke algebras studied here include as a special case the usual finite Iwahori-Hecke algebras of type B when the long root parameter q is generic and the short root parameter Q is chosen so that the algebra is not semisimple (so Q = <h2>\u2212qr </h2> for some r). The orthogonal form allows many of usual problems of representation theory to be solved for these algebras in an unusuallyexplicit way. For example it yields constructions of all theirreducible modules, hence we can compute their dimensions, and all the projective inde- composable modules, hence we can identify the endomorphism algebra of a minimal projective generator. It is a tantalizing problem to try to find some- thinglikethisforcyclotomic Heckealgebrasofhigherlevels, oratrootsofunity, but at the moment this seems out of reach. Once we have explained the orthogonal form, we discuss the main applica- tions obtained in [BS3]\u2013[BS5]. These applications rely also on three generaliza- tions of Schur-Weyl duality. The first of these generalizations was developed in detail already in [BK1], [BK2], and is exploited in [BS3] to relate the level 2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 20C08, 17B10.

ForN\u03bd >1on thecontrary, individuals are randomly dispersed in genome space. The results are extended to geographically dispersed population, where the controlling parameter is shown to be a combination of mutation and migration probability.

Full sets of linear perturbation equations are accurately derived and analysed at the relevant limits. Interesting features of generalisations to other teleparallel models, spatially curved backgrounds,and rotated tetrads are pointed out. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> Teleparallel gravity in its initial formulation is an equivalent way to describe general relativity (GR) in terms of torsion instead of curvature [1]. A. Einstein\u2019s attempts to incorporate electromagnetism in the reformulation, in spaces characterised by parallelism at distance and originally envisaged by E. Cartan, were unsuccessfull [2], but concrete advantages of the reformulation were later clarified by C. M\u00f8ller who found a covariantgravitationalenergy-momentumcomplex [3] anddiscussed the possible resolution of singularities in the tetrad framework1 [5]. In the last decade we have a great resurgence of interest towardssuchalternativeformulations. The reasonsrangefromthe needto revisitthe foundations ofGR [6] to the phenomenological interests in new approaches to modify gravity [7]. In this paper we take the latter viewpoint. In modern cosmology it has become commonly accepted thattheexistenceofthethreewell-knownunknowns,theagentsthataresupposedtocauseinflation,dark matter anddark energy, couldserve as a goodmotivation for modifying the gravitationalinteraction. In particular,theproblemsoftheearlyUniverse[8,9]andthesearchforaself-accelerationmechanisminthe presentdayUniverse[10,11]haveledtooneofthesimplestmodifiedteleparallelmodels,thef(T). Since then, many variations of this model have been proposed to the same aims, with (e.g. [12, 13, 14]) and without(e.g. [15,16,17])additionalscalarfieldsintheaction(see[7]andSection9). Obviously,amodel which aims at solving any of the mentioned cosmological puzzles must be tested against all available sets of cosmological data [18]. One of the first steps to be taken is the theory of linear cosmological perturbations. Wewilltaketheclassicalrouteofworkingwithzerospinconnectioninf(T)(puretetradformulation) becausethecovariantisation[19,20],thoughimportantatthefoundationallevel,introducesnewvariables without changing physical predictions which is impractical for our current purposes. The cosmological perturbation equations for f(T) were given first in the Ref. [21]. It was done in the covariant 1+3 language which might be unfamiliar for many workers in the field, and only in the Appendix were they specifiedtotheNewtoniangauge2. Recentlytheseequationswereused[22]inthefirstactualcomparison with the data.

Introduction Portfolio selection is an important and well studied problem across the disciplines of finance, economics, operations research and computer science. While there are many flavors to approaching this problem, two major streams of literature exist: \u2022 Single or Multi-period optimization: This body of work focuses on what can be done optimally from a mean variance trade-off perspective, in a single or multi-period context. \u2022 Online portfolio selection: The literature here focuses on arriving at the best average growth rate for the portfolio over the long run. In this work we explore the state of the art for online portfolio selection and propose a method for asset allocation in factor driven markets that provides an effective alternative to some of the complex techniques that have been proposed in the literature. 1.1.

Those photons carry away momentum, applying a force on the planet. Here we evaluate the resulting secular changes to the orbit, known as the Yarkovsky effect. For known transiting planets, typical fractional changes in semi-major axis are about 1% over their lifetime, but could be up to \u223c 5% for close-in planets like OGLE-TR-56b or inflated planets like TrES-4. We discuss the origin of the correlation between semi-major axis and surface gravity of transiting planets in terms of various physical processes, finding that radiative thrusters are too weak by about a factor of 10 to establish the lower boundary that causes the correlation.

Introduction Interaction of input parameters for software systems has been introduced as one of the primary sources of failure. Traditional test design techniques are useful for fault discovery and prevention when a single input value causes the fault at a time. However, they may not be adequate to handle faults caused by the interaction of several inputs. Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT) (sometimescalledt-waytestingwheretisthecombinationstrength)addressedthisproblemproperly by taking the interaction of two or more inputs and generating a combinatorial test suite that helps in early fault detection in the testing life cycle [5, 6].

If the RCB stars are the product of white dwarf mergers, this would be a very exciting result since RCB stars would then be low-mass analogs of type Ia supernovae. The predicted number of RCB stars in the Galaxy is consistent with the predicted number of He/CO WD mergers. But, so far, only about 65 of the predicted 5000 RCB stars in the Galaxy have been discovered. The mystery has yet to be solved.

It received the \u201cR\u201d which designates it as the first variable star discovered in the constellation Coronae Borealis. Its brightness variations have been monitored since its discovery over 200 years ago (Pigott & Englefield 1797). Early spectra showed variations in the strengths of the Swan bands of C (Espin 1890) and evidence of the absence of hydrogen was soon 2 detected (Ludendorff 1906; Cannon & Pickering 1912), although not confirmed until later (Berman 1935; Bidelman 1953).

In the latter case, it is natural to ask what conditions it (and the closely related Cosmic Censorship principle) imposes, via gauge-gravity duality, on the boundary field theory. We find that these conditions take the form of lower bounds on the number of colours in this theory: that is, the WGC and Censorship might (depending on the actual sizes of the bounds) enforce the familiar holographic injunction that this number should be \u201clarge\u201d. We explicitly estimate lower bounds on this number in the case of the application of holography to the quark- gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions. We find that classical Censorship alone prohibits realistically small values for the number of colours, but that the WGC offers hope of resolving this problem. "

Particular attention is paidtothestudyofthebispectrumintheregimeofweakdissipationandhowstochasticfluctuations affect the bispectrum. It is shown that, in contrast to the strong dissipative regime, the amplitude of non-Gaussianity is strongly dependent on the parameters governing the microscopic physics in theintermediateandweakdissipationwarminflationregimes. Themostimportantresultsconcern the shape of the bispectrum, which has two different, but distinct, forms in the weak and strong dissipative regimes. PACSnumbers: 98.80.Cq I. INTRODUCTION Inflation remains one of the most appealing solutions to the cosmological puzzles. Observations from the cosmic microwave background are consistent with density perturbations that are very close to Gaussian and scale invariant. Measurementsonnon-GaussiantyfromthefirstyearPlanckdata[1]showthattheyareseverelyconstrainedalthough there remains room that there could be a detectable signal. There are two dynamical pictures of inflation that have been developed. In one the scalar inflaton field is pic- tured to be almost non-interacting with all other fields [2]. Thus, the Universe inflates in a vacuum state and the evolution of the scalar inflaton field is governed by zero temperature physics. This is the cold inflation picture. In the alternative picture, particle production occurs concurrent to inflationary expansion. The scalar inflaton field is governed by fluctuation-dissipation dynamics [3] that controls the seeds of density fluctuations. This is the warm inflation picture [4]. In this picture, for the simplest dynamics the seeds of density perturbation are thermal [3, 5, 6]. The interaction of the scalar field with other fields leads to particle production, which then leads to a dissipation and fluctuation term in the inflaton evolution equation [7, 8]. We should note that since its original proposal warm inflation has evolved quite considerably. Originally, dissipation was computed in the high temperature regime and it was soon realized that thermal corrections to the inflaton potential would spoil inflation [8, 9]. However, more recent model building realizations easily overcomes these early concerns about the implementation of the warm inflation idea (a detailed discussion of these issues and their solution is particularly discussed extensively, for example, in the reviewpaper[10]). Thebasicideaisthatdissipationisdrivenbythecouplingoftheinflatontomassivefields(witha masslargerthanthetemperatureofthethermalbath), whichinturncoupletolight(relativistic)degreesoffreedom. Therefore, in this regime thermal corrections to the effective potential are not an issue. Recent findings reported by the BICEP2 collaboration [11] of a possible primordial tensor mode signal lead to a possible additional observable to help discriminate different inflation models as well as between these two paradigms of inflation. However, this alone may not be sufficient, since both paradigms have promising models for explaining a tensor mode at various energy scales. The most promising hope for discriminating between the two inflationary paradigms could come from measurement of non-Gaussianity. As the measurements of the cosmic microwave back- ground (CMB) radiation becomes more and more precise, it is expected that not only will the magnitude for the non-Gaussianity be measured, but also be possible to determine its shape.

In a Boolean network it is a form of network robustness in which a subset of the input signals control the behavior of a node regardless of the remaining input. It has been shown that Boolean networks can become canalized if they evolve through a frustrated competition between nodes. This was demonstrated for large networks in which each node had K = 3 inputs. Those networks evolve to a critical steady-state at the boarder of two phases of dynamical behavior. Moreover, the evolution of these networks was shown to be associated with thesymmetry of theevolutionary dynamics. Weextendthese resultstothemore highly connected K >3cases andshowthatsimilar canalized critical steady statesemergewith thesameassociated dynamicalsymmetry,butonlyiftheevolutionarydynamicsisbiasedtowardhomogeneousBoolean functions.

Presently, there is a wealth of research relating to the fabrication and application of photonic crystal materials. There a number of structures which fall into the category of a photonic crystal; 1D, 2D and 3D ordered structures can qualify as a photonic crystal, provided there exists ordered repeating lattices of dielectric material with a sufficient refractive index contrast. The optical responses of these structures, namely the associated photonic bandgap or stopband, are of particular interest for any application involving light. The sensitivity of the photonic bandgap to changes in lattice size or refractive index composition creates the possibility for accurate optical sensors. Optical phenomena involving reduced group velocity at wavelengths on the edge of the photonic bandgap are commonly exploited for photocatalytic applications. The inherent reflectivity of the photonic bandgap has created applications in optical waveguides or as solar cell reflector layers. There are countless examples of research attempting to exploit these facets of photonic crystal behavior for improved material design. Here, the role of photonic crystals is reviewed across a wide a variety of disciplines; cataloguing the ways in which these structures have enhanced specific applications. Particular emphasis is placed on providing an understanding of the specific function of the tunable optical response in photonic crystals in relation to their application. 1 "

While probing gravity theories at cosmological scales is a legitimate endeavor byitself,italsotacklesthequestionofwhethertheobservedcosmicaccelerationisduetoanextensionormodification to Einstein\u2019s equations at cosmological scales, or is the result of a repulsive dark energy component permeating the universe. There exists a large body of literature on these questions. We provide a partial list references and reviews on the topic here [1\u201347], and we direct the reader to the citations therein. The precise results of cosmic microwave temperature anisotropies from Planck [48\u201350], the recent data from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey[51, 52], and the CFHTLenS weak lensing data [53\u201357] have all made it appealing to derive and analyze the latest constraints on general relativity or modified gravity parameters. These results will also help to guide us in advancing the analysis frameworks and to point us toward issues that need to be dealt with in a timely manner. In this paper, we contrast results from different ways to parameterize modifications to general relativity (GR).

In this paper, mo- tivated by recently developed stochastic block coordinate algorithms, we propose a highly scalable ran- domized block coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm for convex optimization with general compact convex constraints,whichhasdiverseapplicationsinanalyzingbiomedicaldataforbetterunderstandingcellular and disease mechanisms. We focus on implementing the derived stochastic block coordinate algorithm toalignprotein-proteininteractionnetworksforidentifyingconservedfunctionalpathwaysbasedonthe IsoRank framework. Our derived stochastic block coordinate Frank-Wolfe (SBCFW) algorithm has the convergence guarantee and naturally leads to the decreased computational cost (time and space) for each iteration. Our experiments for querying conserved functional protein complexes in yeast networks confirm the effectiveness of this technique for analyzing large-scale biological networks. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> First-order methods in convex optimization have attracted significant attention in statistical learning in re- centyears. Theyareappealingtomanylearningproblems,suchasLASSOregressionandmatrixcompletion, which have diverse applications in analyzing large-scale biological systems and high-dimensional biomedical measurementprofiles[13,7]. Thesefirst-orderoptimizationmethodsscalewellwiththecurrent\u201cbig\u201ddatain many biomedical applications due to their advantages that they have low computation burden per iteration and they are easy to be implemented on parallel computational resources. In this paper, we focus on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which is also known as the conditional gradient method. One of its advantages is that at each iteration step it decomposes the complex constrained opti- mizationproblemintosub-problemswhichareeasiertosolve. Additionally, itisaprojectionfreealgorithm, which avoids solving the projection problem for constrained optimization as done in many other algorithms. The original Frank-Wolfe algorithm, developed for smooth convex optimization on a polytope, dates back to Frank and Wolfe [4]. Dunn and Harshbarger [2, 3] have generalized the algorithm to solve the optimiza- tion for more general smooth convex objective functions over bounded convex feasible regions. Recently, researchers [9] have proposed stochastic optimization ideas to scale up the original Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Based on these previous seminal efforts, our main contribution in this paper is that we generalize the stochastic block coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm proposed in [9], previously with block separable con- straints, to solve more general optimization problems with any convex compact constraints, including the problemswithblockinseparableconstraints. Suchageneralizedalgorithmhasabroaderrangeofbiomedical applications, including biological network alignment. We prove the convergence of our generalized stochas- tic block coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm and evaluate the algorithm performance for querying conserved functional protein complexes in real-world protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. In the following sections, we first describe the model formulation of the optimization problems that we are generally interested. Specifically, to address potential difficulty from more general convex compact constraints,wederiveanewstochasticblockcoordinateFrank-Wolfealgorithmandprovidetheconvergence proof. Then, we formulate the IsoRank problem for network alignment [11] as a convex programming problem and develop a SBCFW-IsoRank algorithm based on our new stochastic block coordinate Frank- Wolfe algorithm. At last, in our experiments, we show the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm for solving the PPI network query problem. 1 <h1>5102 </h1> <h1>yaM </h1> <h1>62 </h1> <h1>]EC.sc[ </h1> <h1>2v70660.5051:viXra </h1> "

It is closely related to the higher-dimensional Dehn functions, but has more requirements to the fillings. We prove that these additional requirements do not have an essential impact for many nilpotent Lie groups. As a corollary, we obtain the higher divergence of the Heisenberg groups in all dimensions. 1 Introduction Thales\u2019 theorem of intersecting lines is one the classical theorems in Euclidean geometry. In the words of amoderngeometer,itsaysthatgeodesicraysintheEuclideanspacedivergefromeachotherlinearly. As asymptotic property, the speed of the divergence of geodesics is an interesting object to study in many metric spaces. There is a way to describe it by the needed length to connect two points on the boundary of a ball of radius r by a curve which do not intersect the interior of the ball. This can be considered as an isoperimetric inequality and hence generalised to higher dimensions: fill k-cycles outside a ball with (k +1)-chains also outside the ball. So far, this higher divergence has mainly been studied for spaces with non-positive curvature (see [2], [7], [9], [1]). In this article we examine the higher divergence of nilpotent Lie groups with Riemannian metrics. These are metric spaces with all three types of sectional curvature: negative, zero and positive (see [10]). We find out that for a class of nilpotent Lie groups the behaviour in low dimensions are the same as for the filling functions. As a corollary, we obtain the higher divergence of the Heisenberg groups Hn in all C dimensions. As far as we know, this is the first infinite family of metric spaces, not quasi-isometric to non-positively curved spaces, for which the higher divergence is known in all dimensions. Definition 1.1.

The signal is charged Higgs boson pair production in two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) followed by H\u00b1 \u2192 W\u00b1H and H \u2192 b\u00afb. Here, H denotes the heavy CP-even neutral Higgs boson of the model. The collider center of mass energy is chosen \u221a \u221a to be s = 1400 GeV as the second stage of CLIC operation. In this case, m H+ < s/2 can be explored due to the pair production. It is shown that the signal of charged Higgs in the mass range 250 GeV<m H+ <650 GeV in fully hadronic final state, containing four b-jets from neutral Higgs and four jets from W bosons, can well be observed on top of the only remaining standard model background, i.e., tt\u00af.

Introduction Let C be the hypercube in dimension n. The vertex set of C is <h2>{0,1}n, </h2> and two n n vertices are adjacent if they differ on one coordinate. It is known that the number of spanning trees of C is n n 1 (n) (1) T(C n) = <h2>2n </h2> (2i) i . i=1 Y This formula can be obtained by using the matrix-tree theorem and then determining the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the hypercube. This, in turns, can be done either using the representation theory of Abelian groups (applied to the group <h2>(Z/2Z)n) </h2> [5, chapter 5], or by guessing and checking a set of eigenvectors [4]. We will give two combinatorial proofs of this result, thereby answering an open problem mentioned for instance in [5, pp. 62] and [3] (the case n = 3 was actually solved in [6] by a method different from ours).

This approximation provides a complete description of the excitation, relaxation and decoherence dynamics of ensem- bles of coupled quantum systems in weak laser fields, taking into account collective effects and dephasing. In the proposed method one propagates the wave function of the system instead of a complete density matrix. Relaxation and dephasing are taken into account via automatically- adjusted time-dependent gain and decay rates. As an application, we compute the numerical wave packetsolutionofatime-dependentnon-HermitianSchro\u00a8dingerequationdescribingtheinteraction of electromagnetic radiation with a quantum nano-structure and compare the calculated transmis- sion, reflection, and absorption spectra with those obtained from the numerical solution of the Liouville-von-Neumannequation.

Information has become the most precious resource of society. At the same time, there is no consensus on the meaning of the term \u201cinformation,\u201d and many researchers have considered problems of information definition. This results in a quantity of contradictions, misconceptions, and paradoxes related to the world of information. To remedy the situation, a new approach in information theory, which is called the general theory of information, is developed. The main achievement of the general theory of information is explication of a relevant and adequate definition of information. This theory is built on an axiomatic base as a system of two classes of principles and their consequences. The first class consists of the ontological principles, which are revealing general properties and regularities of information and its functioning. Principles from the second class explain how to measure information. Key words: information, ontology, principles, infological system, structure, knowledge 1 "

Kohn January 25, 2022 </h1> Abstract The Stochastic Volatility (SV) model and its variants are widely used in the fi- nancial sector while recurrent neural network (RNN) models are successfully used in many large-scale industrial applications of Deep Learning. Our article combines these two methods in a non-trivial way and proposes a model, which we call the Statistical Recurrent Stochastic Volatility (SR-SV) model, to capture the dynamics of stochastic volatility. The proposed model is able to capture complex volatility effects (e.g., non- linearityandlong-memoryauto-dependence)overlookedbytheconventionalSVmodels, is statistically interpretable and has an impressive out-of-sample forecast performance. These properties are carefully discussed and illustrated through extensive simulation studies and applications to five international stock index datasets: The German stock index DAX30, the Hong Kong stock index HSI50, the France market index CAC40, the US stock market index SP500 and the Canada market index TSX250.

Deep Learning; volatility modelling, recurrent neural networks, financial econometrics. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> The volatility of a financial time series, such as stock returns, is defined as the variance of the returns and serves as a measure of the uncertainty about the returns. The volatility, which is of great interest to financial econometricians, is unobserved and therefore often modelled statistically in order to estimate it. The two model classes most frequently used in volatility modelling are the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (GARCH) models and the Stochastic Volatility (SV) models. The GARCH model (Bollerslev, 1986) expresses the current volatility, conditional on the previous returns and volatilities, as a deterministic and linear function of the squared returns and the conditional volatilities in the previous time period. The SV model (Taylor, 1982, 1986), on the other hand, uses a latent stochastic <h2>\u2217Nguyen </h2> and Tran: Discipline of Business Analytics, University of Sydney Business School and ACEMS.

Our model is based on Markov renewal processes. We consider a point process associated to the timestamps of the price jumps, and marks associated to price increments. By modeling the marks with a suitable Markov chain, we can reproduce the strong mean-reversion of price returns known as microstructure noise. Moreover, by using Markov renewal processes, we can model the presence of spikes in intensity of market activity, i.e. the volatility clustering, and consider dependence between price increments and jump times. We also provide simple parametric and nonparametric statistical procedures for the estimation of our model. We obtain closed-form formula forthemeansignatureplot,andshowthediffusivebehaviorofourmodelatlargescale limit. We illustrate our results by numerical simulations, and find that our model is consistent with empirical data on the Euribor future. 1 Keywords: Microstructure noise, Markov renewal process, Signature plot, Scaling limit. 1Tick-by-tick observation, from 10:00 to 14:00 during 2010, on the front future contract Euribor3m 1 <h1>3102 </h1> <h1>yaM </h1> 1 <h1>]RT.nif-q[ </h1> <h1>1v5010.5031:viXra </h1> "

Introduction Let f : M \u2192 M be a measurable transformation and \u00b5 an f-invariant and ergodic probability measure.

On the other hand, despite the fact that from the ergodic point of view the set of points where the Birkhoff averages do not converge is negligible it can be a topologically large set or have full dimension. To illustrate this fact let us mention that if f is continuous and have the specification property then the set of points where the Birkhoff averagesdo not converge is either empty orhas totaltopologicalpressure with respect to any continuous potential (we refer the readere.g. [35] for details). The study of the topologicalpressure or dimension of the these level sets multifractal can be tracedback to Besicovitchand this topic hadcontributionsbymanyauthorsintherecentyears(see[2,15,11,19,20,22,27, 30,33,32,35,12,40]andreferencestherein).

Inspired by the work of Guerrero and Imanuvilovin[19]onthe viscousBurgerequation,weproveby choosingirrotational data and using the notion of effective velocity developed in [22, 23] that the exact global controllability result does not hold for any time T. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> We considertheviscousshallow water modelwithfriction term.

INTRODUCTION Strong theoretical reasons for considering extra dimensions arise in many theories of physics beyond the Standard Model: the potential role of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity, the possible role of extra dimensions in addressing the hierarchy and flavor problems, and the ability of Kaluza-Klein theory to unify forces. Key to this program is identifying ways in which extra dimensions can be hidden from our macroscopic view. The dominant paradigm of compactification has been greatly successful in producing reasonable four-dimensional effective theories, especially with recent developments in moduli stabilization in string theory. Indeed, there appears to be an embar- rassment of riches, with compactifications using fluxes and branes leading to an enormous \u201clandscape\u201d of possible four-dimensional solutions [1]. Determining the existence ofphenomenologicallyacceptable four-dimensionalvacuum states is important. Equally important is addressing the intrinsically cosmological question of the evolution into these and other vacua. How did our observable universe come to be effectively four-dimensional? If the laws of physics allow for more than one long-lived vacuum state, why do we find ourselves in a vacuum with a small cosmological constant and the particle spectrum of the Standard Model? These and other fundamental questions require an understanding of transitions into different vacua, including states of different macroscopic dimensionality. In this paper we explore a new possibility for dynamical compactification: a spontaneous transition from a higher- dimensional de Sitter background to lower-dimensional spacetimes with vacuum energy that depends on details of the solution. The only ingredients in the simple models we consider are a positive cosmological constant in the original D-dimensional backgroundspace and a q-form gauge field strength. We show that this theory allows for the nucleation of regions containing a macroscopic D q-dimensional spacetime with compactified q-spheres stabilized \u2212 by flux. This process is the inverse of the \u201cspontaneous decompactification\u201d studied by Giddings and Myers [2], and was first suggested therein. We explore the cosmology of these models, including a post-transition inflationary phase that could lead to a realistic universe. Other attempts to dynamically account for our observed four-dimensional world in a higher-dimensional theory include the suggestion of Brandenberger and Vafa [3], who used the properties of intersecting strings to suggest that three spatial dimensions could naturally expand while others remained compact. Karch and Randall [4] argued that agasofbraneswithvariousdimensionalitieswouldrelaxtoonedominatedbythree-branes. Ourproposalstartsfrom a dramatically different initial state: empty de Sitter space in higher dimensions. Of course this is not necessarily a natural starting point from the perspective of string theory, which seems to favor Minkowski or anti-de Sitter vacua. Nevertheless, if some other process formed (for example) a six-dimensional de Sitter vacuum in string theory, our proposalcouldexplainthe transitionfromsix tofour dimensionsandgiventhe paucityofdynamicalexplanationsfor compactification, all such theories are potentially of interest. The post-transition solutions are derived from spherically symmetric black brane solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory, and so share some properties with charged black hole solutions in four dimensions. In fact, we can explain most of the major elements of the D-dimensional solutions and their nucleation by analogy with black holes.

Robust motion planning entails computing a global motion plan that is safe under all possible uncertainty realizations, be it in the system dynamics, the robot\u2019s initial position, or with respect to exter- nal disturbances.

We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a holomorphic self-map \u03c6 of thetridisc to induceabounded composition operator on theassociated Hardyspace. This condition depends on the behaviour of the first and the second derivative of the symbol at boundary points. We also discuss compactness of composition operators on thebidisc and the tridisc. 1. Introduction Let be a domain in <h2>Cd, </h2> let X be a Banach space of holomorphic functions on and U U let \u03c6 : be holomorphic. The composition operator with symbol \u03c6 is defined by U \u2192 U C (f) = f \u03c6, f X. The first question to solve when studying composition operators \u03c6 \u25e6 \u2208 is that of continuity: for which symbols \u03c6 do C induce a bounded composition operator \u03c6 on X? When X is the Hardy space or a weighted Bergman space of the unit disc <h2>D, </h2> the answer is easy: by the Littlewood subordination principle, this is always the case. In several variables, this statement does not hold, and there are simple examples of self- maps of the euclidean ball (resp. of the polydisc) which do not induce a bounded com- position operator on the corresponding Hardy space (see for instance [CSW84, CM95]). Therefore, it is interesting to find a characterization of the symbols \u03c6 inducing a bounded operator C , adding if necessary some regularity conditions on the symbol. For the ball, \u03c6 a very satisfying answer has been provided by Wogen in [Wog88]: he characterized the continuity of C acting on <h2>H2(B </h2> ) or <h2>A2(B </h2> ) provided \u03c6 extends to a <h2>3-function </h2> up to \u03c6 d \u03b1 d C the boundary of B . His characterization involves the first and second order derivatives d of \u03c6 at any \u03be <h2>\u2202B </h2> such that \u03c6(\u03be) <h2>\u2202B </h2> . As a consequence, he got that continuity on d d \u2208 \u2208 <h2>H2(B </h2> ) is equivalent to continuity on <h2>A2(B </h2> ). d \u03b1 d In this paper we investigate the case of the polydisc, more precisely of the tridisc <h2>D3. </h2> It appears that characterizing the continuity of composition operators on <h2>H2(Dd) </h2> is a more difficult task than on <h2>H2(B </h2> ). After a first attempt in [KSZ08], where a necessary d condition is given, the continuity problem was solved in [Bay11] on <h2>A2(D2) </h2> for symbols regular up to the boundary, and on <h2>H2(Dd) </h2> or on any <h2>A2(Dd), </h2> \u03b1 > 1, provided \u03c6 is an \u03b1 \u2212 affine symbol. The case of the Hardy space requires a careful and specific argument since the method of [Bay11] goes through Carleson measures and it is well known that Carleson measures on the Hardy space of the polydisc are difficult objects.

A Survey of Different Methods Used in 2013-2015 </h1> Mohammad Khalil Graz University of Technology,Graz, Austria Martin Ebner Graz University of Technology,Graz, Austria Abstract The area of Learning Analytics has developed enormously since the first International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) in 2011. It is a field that combines different disciplines such as computer science, statistics, psychology and pedagogy to achieve its intended objectives. The main goals illustrate in creating convenient interventions on learning as well as its environment and the final optimization about learning domain\u2019s stakeholders (Khalil & Ebner, 2015b). Because the field matures and is now adapted in diverse educational settings, we believe there is a pressing need to list its own research methods and specify its objectives and dilemmas. This paper surveys publications from Learning Analytics and Knowledge conference from 2013 to 2015 and lists the significant research areas in this sphere. We consider the method profile and classify them into seven different categories with a brief description on each. Furthermore, we show the most cited method categories using Google scholar. Finally, the authors raise the challenges and constraints that affect its ethical approach through the meta-analysis study. It is believed that this paper will help researchers to identify the common methods used in Learning Analytics, and it will assist by establishing a future forecast towards new research work taking into account the privacy and ethical issues of this strongly emerged field. Keywords: Learning Analytics, survey, publications, literacy, techniques Introduction Since the first Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conference in 2011 as well as the Horizon Report in 2013 (Johnson et al., 2013), learning analytics is considered to be an emerging field that would be applied in the different educational settings. This field provides tools and technologies that offer the potentials to do proper interventions and improve education in general. The Society for Learning Analytics and Research (SoLAR) defined it as \u201cthe measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs\u201d. Several studies exchanged views about learning analytics goals. For instance, Khalil and Ebner (2015) introduced learning analytics lifecycle and listed the main surveyed objectives of the past four years of the LAK conferences. 294 "

Notable results of this kind include EPASes in the high-dimensional Euclidean setting for k-center [Bado\u02d8iu, Har-Peled, In- dyk; STOC\u201902] as well as k-median, and k-means [Kumar, Sabharwal, Sen; J. ACM 2010]. Our main contribution is a clean and simple EPAS that settles more than ten clustering problems (across multiple well-studied objectives as well as metric spaces) and unifies well- known EPASes. More specifically, our algorithm gives EPASes in the following settings: \u2022 Clustering objectives: k-means, k-center, k-median, priority k-center, (cid:96)-centrum, or- dered k-median, socially fair k-median (aka robust k-median), or any other objective that canbeformulatedasminimizingamonotone(notnecessarilysymmetric!) normofthedis- tances of the points from the solution (generalizing the symmetric formulation introduced by Chakrabarty and Swamy [STOC\u201919]). \u2022 Metric spaces: Continuous high-dimensional Euclidean spaces, metrics of bounded dou- bling dimension, bounded treewidth metrics, and planar metrics. Prior to our results, EPASes were only known for vanilla clustering objectives (k-means, k- median, and k-center) and each such algorithm is tailored to work for the specific input metric and clustering objective (e.g., EPASes for k-means and k-center in Rd are conceptually very different). In contrast, our algorithmic framework is applicable to a wide range of well-studied objective functions in a uniform way, and is (almost) entirely oblivious to any specific metric structures and yet is able to effectively exploit those unknown structures. In particular, our algorithm is not based on the (metric- and objective-specific) technique of coresets. Key to our analysis is a new concept that we call bounded (cid:15)-scatter dimension\u2014an intrinsic complexity measure of a metric space that is a relaxation of the standard notion of bounded doubling dimension (often used as a source of algorithmic tractability for geometric problems). Our main technical result shows that two conditions are essentially sufficient for our algorithm to yield an EPAS on the input metric M for any clustering objective: (i) The objective is described by a monotone norm, and (ii) the (cid:15)-scatter dimension of M is upper bounded by a function of (cid:15). \u2217University of Wroc\u0142aw, Poland ({fateme.abbasi,jby}@cs.uni.wroc.pl, sandip.ndp@gmail.com) \u2020Aalto University, Espoo, Finland ({parinya.chalermsook,ameet.gadekar}@aalto.fi \u2021University of British Columbia, Canada (kamyar.khodamoradi@ubc.ca) \u00a7CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany (marx@cispa.de) \u00b6Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany ({rsharma,jspoerha}@mpi-inf.mpg.de) \u2016The University of Sheffield, United Kingdom (j.spoerhase@sheffield.ac.uk) <h1>3202 </h1> <h1>rpA </h1> 6 <h1>]SD.sc[ </h1> <h1>1v64130.4032:viXra </h1> "

China Abstract The effect of deposition oxygen pressure (P ) on phase separation (PS) induced in epitaxial O La Ca MnO /NdGaO (001) films was investigated. Fully oxygenated films grown at high P are 0.67 0.33 3 3 O anisotropically strained. They exhibit PS over a wide temperature range, because of the large orthorhombicity of NdGaO substrates. The paramagnetic insulator-to-ferromagnetic metal (FM) and 3 FM-to-antiferromagnetic insulator (AFI) transitions gradually shift to lower temperatures with decreasing P . The AFI state is initially weakened (P \u2265 30 Pa), but then becomes more robust against the magnetic O O field (P < 30 Pa). The out-of-plane film lattice parameter increases with decreasing P . For films grown O O at P \u2265 30 Pa, the slight oxygen deficiency may enlarge the lattice unit cell, reduce the anisotropic strain O and suppress the AFI state. Films deposited at P < 30 Pa instead experience an average compressive O strain. The enhanced compressive strain and structural defects in the films may lead to the robust AFI state. These results aid our understanding of PS in manganite films. PACS number: 75.47.Gk, 75.25.Dk. a) Electronic mail: wuwb@ustc.edu.cn. 1 "

Musslimani Department of Mathematics, Florida State University,Tallahassee, FL 32306-4510 Abstract The spectral renormalization method was introduced by Ablowitz and Musslimani in 2005, [Opt. Lett. 30, pp. 2140- 2142] as an effective way to numerically compute (time-independent) bound states for certain nonlinear boundary value problems. In this paper, we extend those ideas to the time domain and introduce a time-dependent spectral renormalization method as a numerical means to simulate linear and nonlinear evolution equations. The essence of the method is to convert the underlying evolution equation from its partial or ordinary differential form (using Duhamel\u2019s principle) into an integral equation. The solution sought is then viewed as a fixed point in both space and time. The resulting integral equation is then numerically solved using a simple renormalized fixed-point iteration method. Convergence is achieved by introducing a time-dependent renormalization factor which is numerically computed from the physical properties of the governingevolutionequation. The proposedmethod has the ability to incorporatephysics intothesimulationsintheformofconservationlawsordissipationrates.

To reduce the number of times the KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at some energy inside the window) so that the KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration, for practical applications on the order of 10 to 100 windows.

It is shown that only the maximally-symmetric spacetimes can be expressed in both the Robertson-Walker form and in static form \u2013 there are no other static forms of the Robertson- Walker spacetimes. All possible static forms of the metric of the maximally-symmetric spacetimes are presented as a table. The findings are generalized to apply to functionally more general spacetimes: it is shown that the maximally symmetric spacetimes are also the only spacetimes that can be written in both orthogonal-time isotropic form and in static form.

Introduction In the context of Cosmology, the fact that the de Sitter metric can be written in static form [1] permits novel re-interpretation of, for example, cosmological red-shift and \u2018expansion of spacetime\u2019, the more traditional descriptions of which are based on the time-evolving Robertson-Walker metrics. The aim of this effort is to determine to what extent this latitude in interpretation applies to other members of the Robertson-Walker family of spacetimes. It shares with [2] a common motivation, which is to help distinguish between the coordinate-dependent and coordinate-independent aspects of Cosmology. Whilst the initial focus is to find all the static diagonal forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes, it turns out to be just as easy to pose a more general question whose answer reveals an interesting relationship between two quite general functional forms of the metric.

Introduction Image segmentation plays a major role in many computer vision and pattern recognition applications. According to [6], image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into different regions such that each region is, but the union of any two adjacent regions is not, homogenous. The existing image segmenta- tion techniques can be broadly categorized into threshold-based, clustering-based, region-based,edge-basedandphysics-basedsegmentationapproaches[17,6]. There are various hybrid image segmentation techniques, which combine two or more of the aforementioned approaches. Clustering techniques have been widely used to cluster image pixels based on the similarity of their features (e.g. color, texture, etc.). K-means [14] and Fuzzy C-means (FCM) [4] are two of the most popular clustering techniques used for image segmentation. Clustering is an unsupervised learning process, which does not require class la- beleddatasetastrainingdatatoclusterunknownsetofdataintoclusters.

Email: zidek@ipp.cas.cz Abstract: Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) is commonly used to track dynamics in a broad range of materials. Thus, the search for simplification of the acquisition of PL kinetics attracts continuous attention. This paper presents a new robust and straightforward approach to the measurement of PL decay, which is based on randomly fluctuating excitation intensity. The random excitation waveform is attained by using laser speckles generated on a rotating diffuser. Owing to this, the presented technique is able to utilize any coherent excitation source without the necessity to generate short pulses or to controllably modulate the light. PL decay can be computationally reconstructed from the Fourier image of the PL trace. The paper demonstrates the performance of the method, which is able to acquire sub-microsecond dynamics as the impulse response function reaches 300 ns. The reconstructed PL decays were compared to streak camera measurements to verify the method. Finally, potential limitations and applications of the technique are discussed. \u00a9 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement 1. Introduction Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and dynamics provide a vast amount of information about the emitting material \u2013 revealing energy levels of charge carriers [1,2], resolving processes governing the excited energy routes [3,4], even resolving lifetimes of the processes [5]. All the information can be extracted in a non-contact experiment, even in opaque samples. Therefore, PL time-resolved spectroscopy counts among the most used characterization methods in the fields of chemical physics [6,7], biochemistry [8], and material sciences in general. All reported methods for time-resolved PL measurements require an excitation source able to provide us with a short pulse or to be controllably modulated [9-11]. In general, all the methods can be divided into two groups, which measure PL kinetics in the time and the frequency domains. Methods working in the time domain need a source producing correspondingly short pulses. The pulses excite PL, which is either detected by a speedy detection system, is spatially swept (streak camera), or the PL signal is gated (by up- conversion technique, iCCD). Measurements of PL decay in the frequency domain demand using a controllably modulated light intensity, for instance, an acousto-optic modulator or a modulated laser. In order to capture PL decay stretched over different timescales, the intensity modulation has to be facilitated over a broad range of frequencies. In this article, we present a method that, in contrast can use any source of coherent light to measure PL dynamics on the microsecond and sub-microsecond timescale. The core of this method lies in the excitation of the measured sample with a randomly fluctuating intensity of "

This limit amounts to sending to infinity the speed of light c but simultaneously adjusting the coupling constant g of the quantum field theories in such a way to keep finite the energies of the various excitations. The QFT considered here are Toda Field Theories and the O(N) non-linear sigma model.

Pacs numbers: 11.10.St, 11.15.Kc, 11.30.Pb I. INTRODUCTION Nowadays there are known many integrable quantum field theories (QFT) which have relativistic invariance as their distinguished feature: the list includes purely bosonic models, as the Sinh-Gordon, or more generally Toda models [1\u201310], fermionic systems, as the Gross-Neveu model [11], as well as supersymmetric versions of all these examples (see, for instance, [12\u201315]). This list increases even further ifonealsoaddstoittheorieswithsolitonexcitations,astheSineGordonmodel,orvarioussigmamodels based on group manifolds [11, 16, 17]. Compared to this extraordinary richness of examples concerning relativistic integrable models, the paucityofnon-relativisticintegrablemodels(NRIM)withinteractionsstrictlylocalandgalileaninvariant is rather dazzling, their list being essentially given by the Lieb-Liniger model! The fact that the Lieb- Liniger model [18\u201321] is, under certain general conditions discussed below, probably the only non-trivial exampleofNRIMmaynotbeaccidentalandtheaimofthispaperisindeedtoargueabouttheuniversal ubiquityofthismodel.Let\u2019salsoaddthattheonlyotherknownNRIMare,tothebestofourknowledge, variations of the same theme, alias systems made of coupled Lieb-Liniger models relative to different species of particles [20, 21]. Moreover, it is important to stress, the integrability of these coupled Lieb- Linigermodelsisonlyrealisedunderspecialconditions:whentheparticlespecieshavethesamemassand all interactions \u2013 both among the particles of the same species or interspecies \u2013 have the same coupling constant.

We say that G is symmetric with respect to FG(P) if the uniform distribution on V(G) maximizes FG(P). Using the combinatorial definition of the entropy of a graph in terms of its vertex packing polytope and the relationship between the graph entropy and fractional chromatic number, we characterize all graphs which are symmetric with respect to graphentropy. We showthatagraphis symmetricwith respectto graphentropyif andonly if its vertex set can be uniformly covered by its maximum size independent sets. Furthermore, given any strictly positive probability distribution P on the vertex set of a graph G, we show that P is a maximizer of the entropy of graph G if and only if its vertex set can be uniformly coveredby its maximumweightedindependent sets. We alsoshowthatthe problemofdeciding if a graph is symmetric with respect to graph entropy, where the weight of the vertices is given by probability distribution P, is co-NP-hard. <h1>1 Introduction </h1> The entropy of a graph is an information theoretic functional which is defined on a graph with a probability distribution on its vertex set. This functional was originally proposed by J. Ko\u00a8rner in 1973 to study the minimum number of codewords required for representing an information source [7]. Let VP(G) be the vertex packing polytope of a given graph G which is the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of its independent sets. Let n := |V(G)| and P be a probability distribution on V(G). Then the entropy of G with respect to the probability distribution P is defined as H(G,P) = min p log(1/a ). v v a\u2208VP(G) X v\u2208V(G) J. Ko\u00a8rner investigated the basic properties of the graph entropy in several papers from 1973 till 1992 [7, 8, 10, 9, 12, 13, 11]. Let F and G be two graphs on the same vertex set V. Then the union of graphs F and G is the graph F \u222aG with vertex set V and its edge set is the union of the edge set of graph F and the 1 "

They possess soliton solutions having a nice physical interpretation as interacting ex- tended objects. Actually there is no a clear definition of a soliton solution. In the present paper we call a solution of equations an <h2>n-soliton </h2> solution, if it depends on n linearcombinations of independentvariables. Soliton solutions for Toda equations can be constructed with the help of various methods. Asfaraswe know, first explicit solutions of Toda equationsassociated with loop groups were found by Mikhailov [3]. He used the rational dressing method be- ing a version of the inverse scattering method [4]. Note that in general the solutions obtained by Mikhailov are not soliton solutions. Besides, they are described by a re- dundantsetof parameters. Another method used here is the Hirota\u2019s one. Its essence [5] is a change of the dependentvariables which introduces the so called <h2>\u03c4-functions. </h2> Here the final goal is to come to some special bilinear partial differential equations which are solved then perturbatively. The soliton solutions arise when the perturbation series truncates at some finite order. This method was applied to affine Toda systems, for example, in the papers [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The main disadvantage of the Hirota\u2019s method is that there is no a regular method to find the desired transformation from the initial dependent 1SometimesonedealswithTodaequationsassociatedwithaffinegroupsbeingcentralextensionsof loopgroups.

With the current operational phase of the AMS-02 experiment and the ongoingdevelopmentofafuturededicatedexperiment,theGeneralAntiparticleSpectrometer (GAPS), there are exciting prospects for a dark matter detection in the near future. In this paper we develop a detailed and complete re-analysis of the cosmic-ray antideuteron signal, by discussing the main relevant issues related to antideuteron production and propagation through the interstellar medium and the heliosphere. In particular, we first critically revisit thecoalescencemechanismforantideuteronproductionindarkmatterannihilationprocesses. Then,sinceantideuteronsearcheshavetheirbestprospectsofdetectionatlowkineticenergies where the effect of the solar wind and magnetic field are most relevant, we address the impact of solar modulation modeling on the antideuteron flux at the Earth by developing a full numerical 4D solution of cosmic rays transport in the heliosphere. We finally use these improved predictions to provide updated estimates of the reaching capabilities for AMS-02 andGAPS,compatiblewiththecurrentconstraintsimposedbytheantiprotonsmeasurements of PAMELA. After the antiproton bound is applied, prospects of detection of up to about 15 events in GAPS LDB+ and AMS-02 missions are found, depending on the dark matter mass, annihilationrateandproductionchannelfromoneside, andonthecoalescenceprocess, galactic and solar transport parameters on the other. <h1>7102 </h1> <h1>luJ </h1> <h1>52 </h1> <h1>]hp-peh[ </h1> <h1>3v1714.6031:viXra </h1> "

Abstract The present work shows that it is possible to analytically solve a general model to explain the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. First, the within-host model is described, and later a between-host model, where the coupling between them is the viral load of SARS-CoV-2. The within-host model describes the equations involved in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2, and also the immune response; while that the between-Host model analyzes the dynamics of virus spread from the original source of contagion associated with bats, subsequently transmitted to a host, and then reaching the reservoir (Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan ), until finally infecting the human population.

It mainly causes a reduction of the effective metallic Drude weight (proportional to the so-called optical kinetic energy), encountered in the optical conductivity, with respect to the expectation within the nearly-free electron limit (defining the so-called band kinetic energy), as evinced from band-structure theory. In principle, the ratio between the optical and band kinetic energy allows defining the degree of electronic correlations. Through spectral weight arguments based on the excitation spectrum, we provide an experimental tool, free from any theoretical or band-structure based assumptions, in order to estimate the degree of electronic correlations in several systems. We first address the novel iron-pnictide superconductors, which serve to set the stage for our approach.

How to choose input settings for such experiments is an important issue for accu- rate statistical analysis, uncertainty quantification and decision making. Sliced Latin hypercube designs are the first systematic approach to address this issue. However, it comes with the increasing cost associated with an increasing large number of level combinations of the qualitative factors. For the reason of run size economy, marginally coupled designs were proposed in which the design for the quantitative factors is a sliced Latin hypercube design with respect to each qualitative factor. The drawback of such designs is that the corresponding data may not be able to capture the effects between any two (and more) qualitative factorsandquantitativefactors.

The new subspace identification method is referred to as the N2SID (twice theNofNuclearNormandSIDforSubspaceIDentification)method.Inadditiontoincludekey structural knowledge in the solution it integrates the subspace calculation with minimization of a classical prediction error cost function. The nuclear norm relaxation enables us to perform such integration while preserving convexity. The advantages of N2SID are demonstrated in a numerical open- and closed-loop simulation study. Here a comparison is made with another widely used SID method, i.e. N4SID. The comparison focusses on the identification with short data batches, i.e. where the number of measurements is a small multiple of the system order.

Key words. numericalconformalmappings,conformalmodulus,multiplyconnecteddomains, canonicaldomains 1. Introduction. Conformal mappings play an important role in both theoret- ical complex analysis and in certain engineering applications, such as electrostatics, aerodynamics, and fluid mechanics. Existence of conformal mappings of simply con- nected domains onto the upper-half plane or the unit disk follows from the Riemann mappingtheorem,andtherearegeneralizationsofthisresultfordoublyandmultiply connected domains [2]. However, constructing such mappings analytically is usually very difficult, and numerical methods are required. There exists an extensive literature on numerical construction of conformal map- pings for simply and doubly connected domains [26]. One popular method is based on the Schwarz-Christoffel formula [12], and its implementation SC Toolbox is due to Driscoll [10, 11]. SC Toolbox itself is based on earlier FORTRAN package by Tre- fethen [29]. A new algorithm involving a finite element method and the harmonic conjugate function was presented by the authors in [14]. Whilethestudyofnumericalconformalmappingsinmultiplyconnecteddomains dates back to 1980\u2019s [24, 27], recently there has been significant interest towards the subject. DeLillo, Elcrat and Pfaltzgraff [8] were the first to give a Schwarz- Christoffel formula for unbounded multiply connected domains. Their method relies on the Schwarzian reflection principle. Crowdy [4] was the first to derive a Schwarz- Christoffelformulaforboundedmultiplyconnecteddomains, whichwasbasedonthe use of Schottky-Klein prime function. In a very recent paper [28] conformal maps frommultiplyconnecteddomainsontolemniscaticdomainshavebeendiscussed. The natural extension of this result to unbounded multiply connected domains is given in [5]. It should be noted that a MATLAB implementation of the Schottky-Klein prime function is freely available [6], and the algorithm is described in [7]. A method involving the harmonic conjugate function is given in [23], but the approach there differs from ours. The foundation of conjugate function methods for simply and doubly connected domainsliesonpropertiesofthe(conformal)modulus,whichoriginatesfromthethe- ory of quasiconformal mappings [1, 21, 26]. Here we extend the methods to multiply connected domains. In terms of partial differential equations, one has to solve the \u2217Aalto University, Institute of Mathematics, P.O.

By using a blinking optical tweezers, we extend the range of previous experiments by several orders of magnitude up to a few seconds. The measured mean square displacement of a freely diffusing Brownian particle in a liquid shows a deviation from the Einstein-Smoluchowsky theory that diverges with time. These results are consistent with a generalized theory that takes into account not only the particle inertia but also the inertia of the fluid surrounding the particle.

We establish the existence of time-dependent solitons in a modified gravity framework, which is defined by the low energy limit of theories with a weakly broken galileon symmetry and a mass term. These are regular vacuum configurations of finite energy characterized by a single continuous parameter representing the amplitude of the scalar degree of freedom at the origin. When the central field amplitude is small the objects are indistinguishable from boson stars. In contrast, increasing the central value of the amplitude triggers the effect of higher derivative operators in the effective theory, leading to departures from the previous solutions, until the theory becomes strongly coupledandmodel-dependent. Thehigherorderoperatorsarepartofthe(beyond)Horndeskitheory, hence the name of the compact objects. Moreover, a remnant of the galileon non-renormalization theorem guarantees that the existence and properties of these solutions are not affected by quantum corrections. Finally, we discuss the linear stability under small radial perturbations, the mass-radius relation, the compactness, the appearance of innermost stable circular orbits and photon spheres, and some astrophysical signatures (accretion disks, gravitational radiation and lensing) that may be relevant to falsify the model.
